That&#8217;s the most important part of the maintenance. Otherwise you&#8217;ll end up adding the CSS in random places in random ways. And adding more specificity every time you are in trouble, not good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I personally mix ITCSS and utility classes in PHP based WordPress theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">High level goals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">All of the different CSS methodologies have similar goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li>No conflicts with other components or visual regression when writing or updating CSS.<ul><li>How many times we have broke something else when updating one line of CSS.</li></ul></li><li>It should be super clear where to add or update CSS.</li><li>It should scale for bigger changes.</li><li>More efficient workflow for developers (teams) when CSS structure is clear.</li><li>No deep specificity.<ul><li>How many times we have added more specificity to modify components. And then more. And then more. And then more. This needs to stop.</li></ul></li><li>No conflicts with JS.<ul><li>If component uses JS, developers should instantly know about it.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Harry Roberts have outlined similar <a href=\"https://cssguidelin.es/#architectural-principles\">CSS architecture in his guidelines</a>. Also Jarno Rantanen has nice <a href=\"https://github.com/jareware/css-architecture\">CSS architecture examples</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">ITCSS CSS architecture</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"731\" height=\"437\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/itcss-layers2.svg\" alt=\"ITCSS layers in inverted triangle.\" class=\"wp-image-71643\"/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href=\"https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/\">ITCSS article</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">ITCSS stands for <strong>Inverted Triangle CSS.</strong> It separates CSS codebase to several sections (layers). And every sections adds more specificity to CSS in the right order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Here is example what CSS sections could look like in WordPress theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"\"><li><strong>Settings</strong>: global variables like fonts and colors.</li><li><strong>Tools</strong>: mixins and functions.</li><li><strong>Generic</strong>: Resets and box-sizing.</li><li><strong>Elements</strong>: unclassed HTML elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>.</li><li><strong>Layouts</strong> (objects): undecorated design patterns, such as global layouts and wrappers.</li><li><strong>Blocks</strong>: styles for Core and custom blocks.</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: styles for components, such as navigation and pagination.</li><li><strong>Custom layer</strong>: If there is need for custom layer, feel free to add it in. It’s OK to be before blocks and components.</li><li><strong>Utilities</strong>: Utility classes which overwrites previous layers styles, like <strong>.screen-reader-text</strong> and <strong>prefers-reduced-motion</strong>.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For more details this is great article about using <a href=\"https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/\">ITCSS: Scalable and Maintainable CSS Architecture</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">All I can say is that I have successfully used ITCSS architecture in several large scale projects. It works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">CSS class prefixes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When working on large team with different backgrounds, class prefixes can help understand what job that class are doing. And in what layer they belong in, for example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li><strong>.l-</strong> for layouts, such as <strong>.l-grid</strong></li><li><strong>.c-</strong> for components, such as <strong>.c-menu</strong></li><li><strong>u- </strong>for utilities, such as <strong>.u-reset-list</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Brad Frost have more details and examples in brilliant article <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/\">CSS Architecture for Design Systems</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">CSS guidelines and linting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Follow CSS guidelines and let linting do the hard work enforcing those guidelines. I personally use</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li><a href=\"https://cssguidelin.es/\">CSS guidelines by Harry Roberts</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/chris-pearce/css-guidelines\">CSS guidelines by Chris Pearce</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And then enforce them using <a href=\"https://stylelint.io/\">stylelint</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">BEM naming convention</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><a href=\"http://getbem.com/\">BEM</a>  stands for “Block Element Modifier”.  It helps with our goals to keep specificity low.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li> <strong>Block </strong>is the primary component block, such as <strong>.menu</strong>.</li><li><strong>Element </strong>is a child of the primary block, such as <strong>.menu__item</strong>.</li><li><strong>Modifier </strong>is a variation of a component style, such as <strong>.menu&#8211;primary</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In HTML BEM classes can look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;nav class=”menu menu--primary”>\n   &lt;ul class=”menu__items”>\n      &lt;li class=”menu__item”>&lt;a class=”menu__anchor”>Home&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n      &lt;li class=”menu__item”>&lt;a class=”menu__anchor”>About&lt;/a>&lt;/li>\n   &lt;/ul>\n&lt;/nav></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In CSS we could nest BEM rules like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.menu {\n   &amp;--primary {}\n   &amp;__items {}\n   &amp;__item {}\n   &amp;__anchor {}\n}\n\n// Compiled CSS\n.menu {}\n.menu--primary {}\n.menu__items {}\n.menu__item {}\n.menu__anchor {}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And it would compile in CSS like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>// Compiled CSS\n.menu {}\n.menu--primary {}\n.menu__items {}\n.menu__item {}\n.menu__anchor {}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It&#8217;s perfectly fine not to nest CSS rules though. Ones again Brad have good article about <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/sass-selectors-to-nest-or-not-to-nest/\">nest or not to nest CSS selectors</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">I dequeue block editor styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I  <strong>dequeue Core block styles </strong>from front-end and editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action(\n\t'enqueue_block_assets',\n\tfunction() {\n\t\t// Overwrite Core block styles with empty styles.\n\t\twp_deregister_style( 'wp-block-library' );\n\t\twp_register_style( 'wp-block-library', '' );\n\t\t// Overwrite Core theme styles with empty styles.\n\t\twp_deregister_style( 'wp-block-library-theme' );\n\t\twp_register_style( 'wp-block-library-theme', '' );\n\t},\n\t10\n);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Then I  enqueue almost the same stylesheet for the editor than in the front-end. The goal is to avoid much manual work. You can compare these stylesheets in the Github:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/wcnordic2019/blob/master/assets/css/style.css\">style.css for the front-end</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/wcnordic2019/blob/master/assets/css/editor.css\">editor.css for the editor</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">By default these are the styles which needs some extra work in the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li>Typography.</li><li>Post title. </li><li>Block width, wide, and full widths. </li><li>Search block.</li><li>code block.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Adding editor-styles-wrapper class</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For editor styles there needs to be <strong>.editor-styles-wrapper </strong>class added so that editor styles doesn&#8217;t leak outside the editor.  There are couple of ways to do this automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"\"><li>Use SASS nesting.</li><li>Use PostCSS plugins like <a href=\"https://github.com/m-e-h/postcss-editor-styles\">PostCSS editor styles</a>.</li><li>Use <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/theme-support/#editor-styles\">Core editor styles support</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Nesting in SASS could look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@import \"settings/variables.css\";\n@import \"tools/mixins.css\";\n\n// Editor CSS wrapper.\n.editor-styles-wrapper {\n   @import \"elements/index.css\";\n   @import \"blocks/index.css\";\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I personally use PostCSS editor styles plugin which basically adds <code>.editor-styles-wrapper</code><strong> </strong>class automatically to editor styles. <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/wcnordic2019/blob/master/postcss.config.js\">Config for this can be seen on postcss.config.js file</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Torque Magazine video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I also had a quick chat about with Torque Magazine.

I was hosting the meetup and shared my opinions about Gutenberg. We also got our hands dirty and tested Gutenberg. In short people were worried about the Gutenberg. It&#8217;s such a huge change.</p>\n<p>Here are my slides about Gutenberg Meetup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT7Qtx4AqC_2wkoECVAiq6CFkqn5xgRWuNZHj9p_h9tOvPgAHDp7RA-QFLAC2LK1jpJe5rNDH5gAb-r/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g26c98ed295_0_5\">Gutenberg Slides in Google Sheets</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Gutenberg-WP-Helsinki-Meetup-notes.pdf\">Gutenberg Slides in PDF format</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the next chapters I share my opinions and summary of our conversations in Gutenberg Meetup.</p>\n<h2>What is the Gutenberg?</h2>\n<p>Gutenberg is the new editing experience which is based on blocks. Matt Mullenweg describes Gutenberg like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The editor will endeavour to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words it&#8217;s going to change how we write the  content (blocks).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also changing how developers interact with the content. With Gutenberg we could create stunning posts, landing pages, or product pages. Now we need ACF, CMB2, or similar custom fields solutions. Or Page builders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg development is happening in the Github</a>. Frequently asked questions is a long list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When is it released?</li>\n<li>Can I disable the Gutenberg?</li>\n<li>Why not build blocks with ACF, CMB2, or Page builders?</li>\n<li>Does it support meta boxes?</li>\n<li>Will there be columns?</li>\n<li>How can I build custom blocks?</li>\n<li>Is it accessible?</li>\n<li>And the list goes on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the answers can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/faq.md\">Gutenberg FAQ page</a>. <a href=\"https://go.tinymce.com/blog/gutenberg-myth-busting/\">Gutenberg Myth-Busting</a> also have good overview.</p>\n<h2>When is Gutenberg released</h2>\n<p>Current plan is merging Gutenberg into WordPress 5.0. I hope it doesn&#8217;t happen before second quarter of 2018. There are still lot&#8217;s of testing and finishing up to do.</p>\n<p>Even when Gutenberg lands most of the companies are not ready for using it in their clients sites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It takes time to educate the clients.</li>\n<li>Companies might have custom workflows for publishing.</li>\n<li>It takes time to build custom blocks, or check styles for Core blocks.</li>\n<li>Some things will be broken because most companies don&#8217;t have time to test all their sites beforehand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Gutenberg is going to be default editor there is going to be long (1-2 years) transition period. And disabling Gutenberg is the only option. There is already <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic editor</a> for that.</p>\n<p>Also Classic Text block is good way to start transition. It&#8217;s basically the same as current editor and all extended stuff for current editor should work there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wide alignnone wp-image-36224 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block.png\" alt=\"Classic text block\" width=\"1450\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block.png 1450w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block-300x77.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block-768x198.png 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block-1024x264.png 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block-1240x320.png 1240w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/classic-text-block-1080x279.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px\" /></p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s wrong with ACF or Page Builders for creating landing pages and content?</h2>\n<p>Nothing. But I believe Gutenberg will eventually have better user experience for creating the main content. Custom fields will still be useful for additional content. I don&#8217;t see them going anywhere.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a strong opinion about Page builders because I don&#8217;t need them myself. Just be careful about consequences and lock in effect. Pippin have <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/wordpress-page-builder-plugins-critical-review/\">the best critical review of Page builders</a>. But I certainly hope that many Page builders start creating custom blocks. Start with columns and nested blocks and you have a winner!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pohjois-tapiola.com/lukio/ysilaisille/\">My school site</a> is the easiest example what I&#8217;d like to build with Gutenberg. Page have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Columns.</li>\n<li>Videos.</li>\n<li>Call to actions (buttons, image overlays).</li>\n<li>Elements which are wider than base content.</li>\n<li>Pulling any content like posts or Instagram images.</li>\n<li>Testimonials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All those sounds like Gutenberg blocks to me. Check also <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/31/gutenberg-themes/\">Matias Ventura video demos</a> about theming. I can already see myself creating a page template where you can only fill in the blanks. Sometimes locking the blocks is vice so that user can&#8217;t mess with the design.</p>\n<h2>Meta box support</h2>\n<p>Meta box support has to be in Gutenberg, there is no question about that. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2804\">Initial meta box support is already implemented</a> but I haven&#8217;t fully tested how well it works.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugins like Yoast SEO seems to work OK.</li>\n<li>Also CMB2 worked OK.</li>\n<li>Then again custom fields with Carbon Fields was broken and most of the fields was missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naturally meta boxes needs more testing and polishing in the Gutenberg. Anyways meta boxes appear under Extended Settings.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wide alignnone wp-image-36230 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support.png\" alt=\"Meta boxes in Gutenberg\" width=\"1400\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support.png 1400w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support-300x126.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support-768x323.png 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support-1024x430.png 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support-1240x521.png 1240w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/meta-box-support-1080x454.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" /></p>\n<h2>Testing Gutenberg</h2>\n<p>We tested Gutenberg like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://poopy.life/\">Poopy.life</a> create new testing site if you don&#8217;t have local environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Install Gutenberg as a plugin</a>.

And has been speaking since version 4.2. Lately I&#8217;ve been learning more Javascript and needed this feature in one project. In this article I&#8217;ll try to explain simplified version how WordPress speaks with <code>wp.a11y.speak()</code> JavaScript method.</p>\n<p>Usually we have spinner or animation to indicate that our AJAX update have happened, and we can see the end result. With <code>wp.a11y.speak()</code> assistive technologies like screen readers can announce same updates from AJAX responses. Isn&#8217;t that cool!</p>\n<p>Here are reference article and demo links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/04/15/let-wordpress-speak-new-in-wordpress-4-2/\">Original article how WordPress speaks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/wp-a11y-speak\">Example code in Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/wordpress-speaks/\">WordPress speaking demo site</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/js/wp-a11y.js\">wp.a11y.js file</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How WordPress speaks</h2>\n<p>In my demo I have two examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Filter contacts based on the city where they live.</li>\n<li>Filter posts by category using WordPress REST API.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/wordpress-speaks/\">see from the demo</a> site both forms have <code>select HTML</code> element but there is no submit button at all. We do dynamic changes using Javascript every time option have been changed. That&#8217;s where <code>wp.a11y.speak()</code> kicks in.</p>\n<p>When you enqueue <code>wp-a11y</code> two empty placeholders are added just before closing <code>body</code> element. <code>HTML</code> code looks like this.</p>\n<p><strong>ARIA polite</strong>:</p>\n<pre>&lt;div id=\"wp-a11y-speak-polite\" class=\"screen-reader-text wp-a11y-speak-region\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-relevant=\"additions text\" aria-atomic=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p><strong>ARIA assertive</strong>:</p>\n<pre>&lt;div id=\"wp-a11y-speak-assertive\" class=\"screen-reader-text wp-a11y-speak-region\" aria-live=\"assertive\" aria-relevant=\"additions text\" aria-atomic=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>Now you can call <code>wp.a11y.speak( UpdateMessage )</code> method two ways in your Javascript:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calling <code>wp.a11y.speak( 'Update successful message', 'polite' )</code> notify updates but wait before other tasks are done by assistive technologies. This is the default value.</li>\n<li>Calling <code>wp.a11y.speak( 'Update successful message', 'assertive' )</code> notify updates immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example <code>wp.a11y.speak( 'Update successful message', 'polite' )</code> updates message inside the <code>div</code> element and screen readers announce the update.</p>\n<pre>&lt;div id=\"wp-a11y-speak-polite\" class=\"screen-reader-text wp-a11y-speak-region\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-relevant=\"additions text\" aria-atomic=\"true\"&gt;Update successful message&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>In VoiceOver it looks like this after filtering value have changed:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-1024x279.png\" alt=\"Announce update message in VoiceOver\" width=\"740\" height=\"202\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-35315\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-1024x279.png 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-300x82.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-768x210.png 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-1240x338.png 1240w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak-1080x295.png 1080w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/announce-update-message-wp-a11y-speak.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h2>Video demo</h2>\n<p>Video might help undestand better how VoiceOver announce updates.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"WordPress speaks with wp.a11y.speak\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQI6HqU-zSA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Reference links</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.

But it was worth to wait. I have followed their work for years and they build very attractive and creative WordPress themes.</p>\n<p>This is part of the <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wordpress-theme-shops-trust/\">WordPress theme shops interview</a> series. I hope you have some time to read Elmastudio&#8217;s story, who they are, and what they do.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: Who is behind Elmastudio and what is the history about Elmastudio?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Hi, we are Ellen and Manuel from Elmastudio. We are a husband and wife team from Germany (now living in New Zealand), who build WordPress themes and blog about WordPress since 2009. We started out as freelance web designers and created a blog to share all things web design and WordPress that we learned along the way.</p>\n<p>After designed two free themes for our blog readers and for WordPress.org, we created our first Premium WordPress theme in 2012. From there on we created more and more themes and now have over 30 WordPress themes on our Elmastudio website.</p>\n<p>We just love our work and we love that we are able to work together every day and do work and theme designs that we really love ourselves. We also love to help others to create their own websites and it&#8217;s always so much fun to see our work being uses by so many people.</p>\n<h2>Elmastudio themes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-27256\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta-1016x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Weta\" width=\"740\" height=\"746\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta-1016x1024.jpg 1016w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta-150x150.jpg 150w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta-298x300.jpg 298w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta-768x774.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Weta.jpg 1020w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: What kind of themes you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We started out creating blog themes, since we also blogged on Elmastudio and our readers where mostly bloggers themselves. After a number of themes we wanted to try something a little different and opened up to new theme ideas, like business and portfolio themes and later also eCommerce themes. I think since we both come from a design background, we focus a lot on web design and we love minimalism.</p>\n<p>Therefore a lot of our theme users are designers or other type of creatives as well. But of course since our themes have a very minimal design approach, they can be used for a wide range of websites and we love that our theme users have websites with a lot of different topics. We have a lot of users who are travel, tech or food bloggers, small business owners, freelancers or photographers.</p>\n<h2>Showcase your themes</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of.</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Oh, that&#8217;s difficult! Of course we love all our themes and they all come with some history and remind us of the time we created them. But since we always keep learning new things, too, of course we love our latest themes a lot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-27236\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku-790x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Uku WordPress Theme\" width=\"740\" height=\"959\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku-790x1024.jpg 790w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku-231x300.jpg 231w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku-768x996.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Uku.jpg 876w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Especially with our latest theme <a href=\"https://www.elmastudio.de/en/themes/uku/\">Uku</a>, we tried something a little bit new for us. We wanted to be able to work longer on one theme, instead of switching to a complete new theme design after completing a theme. So Uku has more theme design and layout options compared to our other themes, which is a lot of fun for us to create and continue to work on.</p>\n<p>Our probably most famous theme is <a href=\"https://www.elmastudio.de/en/themes/zuki/\">Zuki</a>, since it became really popular on WordPress.com as well and a lot of people use it for their Magazine style blog. I think at the time we created Zuki, there weren&#8217;t a lot of themes out there, which had a similar design approach and a Magazine-style layout that is more flexible than the classic WordPress blog design (which we love to, for instance in our Cocoa theme).</p>\n<p>Then <a href=\"https://www.elmastudio.de/en/themes/weta/\">Weta</a> was also a little bit special for us as well, since it was our first eCommerce theme. That was kind of scary for us at first, because we felt that online shops have to be very technical. But we started to get more and more into designing for WooCommerce and now it&#8217;s a lot easier for us now.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: From a lot of different places I think. We love to browse through Magazine and art book stores to find inspiration outside of the internet. It is very helpful to get out of your familiar world. Technically we also have to see what other themes are offering of course, but besides that we don&#8217;t like to look at other themes that much, since we find it distracting.</p>\n<p>We love to look at design inspirations on Pinterest and other design inspiration websites, too, just to get us started with a first idea. Once we have developed a design idea, we try to focus with our own design and again don&#8217;t look too much around us.</p>\n<h2>Business and marketing</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: What is your business and marketing strategy?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: From the very beginning we wanted to be able to sell themes mostly on our own Elmastudio website. We felt that this way we were able to create our own prices and offer bundles, specials or discounts whenever we wanted.</p>\n<p>But we started to create two free themes first, before selling our first Premium theme and we also sell a number of our themes on WordPress.com. We are also always option to try new things. I think this is very important, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We really love our work and feel blessed every day to be able to work with so much freedom and do work that we love and that other people love to use. That was always the main focus why we started creating our own WordPress themes in the first place and there was never a day we didn&#8217;t like our work.</p>\n<p>To be honest numbers where never our focus as long as we were able to continue with our work. I believe if you look at the numbers of your own business too much, you can&#8217;t create the best work you are able to create (I know it sounds a little bit naive, but it always worked for us). So we always worked on keeping our work and our output in our main focus and try to create the best work we can possibly create.</p>\n<h2>How you build themes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wide alignnone wp-image-27244 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki.jpg\" alt=\"Zuki WordPress Theme\" width=\"1600\" height=\"808\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki.jpg 1600w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki-300x152.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki-768x388.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki-1024x517.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki-1240x626.jpg 1240w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Zuki-1080x545.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: We always start with a theme concept and then try to find the best design idea for this specific website concept. This takes a little while and is also always the most stressful part of our theme building process. Once we settled on a design idea as well, it gets easier and we start building section by section of the web design. Manuel does all the design work in Sketch. From the very beginning we work together to find the best solution from the design and the development perspective.</p>\n<p>Then I start to code a rough version of the theme design as soon as possible, just to test things out. I use Atom as my editor and we mostly work with Chrome as our browser, when developing themes. When the design is more polished and we also have the mobile design ready, Manuel transfers all design templates to Zeplin, which I love as a developer.</p>\n<p>Zeplin makes it easy to work together as a designer/developer team and I can see all the information I need for my code right in Zeplin. We have kind of our own version of a starter theme with _s as a basis, but we also come up with new approaches depending on the needs of each new theme.</p>\n<h2>Future plans</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: From my perspective I think the tendencies are that a single theme can now be way more complex then it used to be. And in one way I like that, since it makes it possible to develop and work on a theme for a longer time. But I also like clean, small and simple theme for one specific purpose and I think they will also continue to exist and make sense to use for a lot of people.</p>\n<p>So I believe there will be a lot of different themes out there in the future, too, and that is also the great thing about WordPress. There are so many users with very different needs, so it&#8217;s possible to create a number of very different themes that all find their fans and user base.</p>\n<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>\n<p><strong>Sami</strong>: Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</p>\n<p><strong>Ellen</strong>: Again I think the most important thing is that there is no right or wrong theme, but rather it&#8217;s important to find the perfect and best fitting theme for your own website. For theme developers that means too, that there are endless options how to build WordPress themes and we just have to find the best way that works for us and our theme users.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to believe in your work and in your way of doing things and not get irritated by the work of others too much. There are so many different WordPress themes out there, that it&#8217;s more and more important to find your own approach and your own personal niche.</p>\n","<p>This interview with Elmastudio was long time coming.

Or should I say it was all about <a href=\"http://www.bouncepingpong.com/\">playing ping pong</a>! Which was super fun.</p>\n<p>I also ate too much. It was time to get some rest and get ready for my talks.</p>\n<h2>Talks &#8211; mine included</h2>\n<p>There is no way to pick the best talks I went to see. There were so many good ones going on in the same time. And this is not a competition. There were plenty of different type of talks for everybody.</p>\n<p>I know that the best talk that I didn’t see was from Adrian Roselli: <a href=\"http://adrianroselli.com/2017/03/selfish-accessibility-slides-from-wordcamp-london-2017.html\">Selfish Accessibility</a>.</p>\n<p>My first “talk” was on Saturday.

We could easily talk about 4 hours about themes but we had only 40 minutes to talk about for example these topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do you build your themes &#8211; from scratch, starter theme, parent theme, framework?</li>\n<li>How do you deal with your core CSS layout &#8211; framework (like Bootstrap), own code/bespoke?</li>\n<li>How do you code your CSS &#8211; pre-processors vs vanilla CSS?</li>\n<li>How do you deploy custom layout in-page sections?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theme panel turned out to be pleasant experience. Jonny kept good rhythm and panelist have different kind of perspective how to build themes. We worked together as team really well!</p>\n<p>On Sunday I had a lightning talk about SVG icon system in WordPress.

But Matt does so much more than just tweets or build themes. <a href=\"http://craftedbymatt.com/\">Crafted by Matt</a> is the site where you can check what he&#8217;s up to. You should definitely start following Matt and  check his products. Thanks again for the interview! Let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n<h2>Introduction &#8211; Who is Matt</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: Thanks for taking the time for interview. Could you first shortly introduce yourself?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: My name is Matt and I’m a digital agency owner, product maker, and podcast host.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: I&#8217;ve been following you and your great sites for a while now. But I&#8217;m still not sure what kind of business you have. Could you give an overview of your businesses and sites, what do you actually do?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: My core business is providing custom WordPress development services to higher education, traditional publishers, and business-to- business clients over at <a href=\"http://slocumstudio.com/\">SlocumStudio</a>. We learn how our customers experience WordPress, what they ask for in themes, what they need in displaying content and then re-purpose that knowledge into our themes at <a href=\"https://slocumthemes.com/\">SlocumThemes</a>, and our plugin <a href=\"https://conductorplugin.com/\">ConductorPlugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Since we live and breath WordPress at all angles, I distill that knowledge into conversations with other WordPress business owners at <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/\">MattReport</a>, and train people how to use WordPress at <a href=\"https://plugintut.com/\">PluginTut</a>.</p>\n<h2>Slocum Themes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: You also have WordPress theme shop called Slocum Themes. What kind of themes you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: I kind of go against the grain on “typical” marketing advice with my theme shop. Right now, we’re building themes that work for us, meaning, we only release a theme if it’s going to work well with our Conductor or Note plugins. Since our themes derive from client work, releasing a new theme fully depends on finding the right project where we can do that.</p>\n<h2>Showcase Themes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: Showcase two of your themes that your users like most. Why they like them?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Our two most popular themes are <a href=\"https://slocumthemes.com/wordpress-themes/baton/\">Baton theme</a> and <a href=\"https://slocumthemes.com/wordpress-themes/simple-shop-pro/\">Simple Shop theme</a>. Baton is a “feature” theme. That’s a term I’m coining to replace “multi-purpose” themes. Baton isn’t narrow like a food theme, and not as wide as a page builder theme. It works great with our Note plugin and Conductor plugin and that’s why people enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Simple Shop just happens to have the look and feel that people want for their business. It’s a dark grid-based theme that works for certain verticals.</p>\n<h2>Business Strategy</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: What is your business strategy for themes?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: The strategy is simple, but probably not that popular. We’re building themes when we can, we’ve got a few ideas for themes, and when there’s time between client work &#8212; we’ll start to build them out. Theme products still can’t take the forward focus for us, like Conductor plugin and client services do.</p>\n<h2>Future of WordPress Themes</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: How do you see the future of WordPress themes business? Any tips to give from your own experience?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: I’ve got another unpopular statement: I think it’s going to be harder to market niche themes. There’s a massive push to builder plugins and themes, that allow customers to design whatever they want &#8212; and they’re getting better. Niche themes of the future might be laser focused in design, but feature rich in terms of what they can do.</p>\n<p>Then there’s everyone’s favorite prediction: The REST API. I’m “assuming” that will dramatically change things, but you don’t know until the market shifts that direction.</p>\n<h2>Tools for Online Business</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: What kind of tools you use to run online business? (Newslettesr, podcasts, automation, selling themes etc.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Everything! Podcasts, e-mail marketing, marketing automation, blogging, videos, screencasts, live shows, and social media. I’ve only dabbled in pay per click promotions, I just haven’t had the time to really drill down and build a successful campaign.</p>\n<h2>Open floor</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Sami</strong>: Open floor. Any other tips and tricks to share?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Matt</strong>: I’ve got two thoughts I’d like to leave developers with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get better at telling your story</li>\n<li>Provide value when you raise prices</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A lot of developers, and designers for that matter, are afraid to tell the story about their software. Perhaps some don’t need to because their sales are doing great, and SEO is working in their favor. That said, I can guarantee what’s working for them now, won’t be working in 2 years.</p>\n<p>If you’re not putting your story out now, grabbing people’s attention, who are they going to turn to in two years? Not you. Start doing a better job at giving people a reason to tune in to you and your products &#8212; today.</p>\n<p>It’s easy for all of us to say we should raise our prices, but at the same time, you need to maintain value. If the market doesn’t see support as value, you can’t use that as a crutch, no matter how painful that is.</p>\n<p>The market is never getting easier, there’s always going to be someone that does it better &amp; cheaper, but you need to find the specific value that only you can provide to your customer.</p>\n","<p>Do you still remember my trusted WordPress theme shops?

I have written technical overview <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">how to build accessible themes</a>. But that alone is not enough. Writing accessible content is big part of having accessible site.</p>\n<p>In this article I summarise good and bad practises about writing accessible content. It&#8217;s mostly for WordPress but same tips can be applied to any platform.</p>\n<h2>Write easy to read text</h2>\n<p>People have hard time reading on the web. They might quickly scan the page and pick sentences here and there. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jsaito/how-to-design-words-63d6965051e9#.g4qoc3dd8\">How to design words</a> article have excellent tips how to write easy to read text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trim it down</strong>: Keep your sentences short and to the point. Use simple words, and then trim the text again. And again.</li>\n<li><strong>Use headings</strong>: Headings helps scanning your text. They give structure to your page.</li>\n<li><strong>Use lists</strong>: Lists are usually easier to read and scan than paragraphs.</li>\n<li><strong>Give readers a break</strong>: It can be hard to read long text. Headings, lists, images,  and short  paragraphs are good way of giving a break to readers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now go back and read more details <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jsaito/how-to-design-words-63d6965051e9#.g4qoc3dd8\">how to design words</a>. There are couple of extra points about prioritizing words and the slow reveal of content.</p>\n<h2>Headings hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Headings defines the structure and hierarchy of a page. Sighted users can scan your text faster and get the idea of the structure and content of the page. I&#8217;m pretty sure search engines like headings too.  🙂</p>\n<p>Also screen reader and other assistive technology (AT) users can navigate the content by heading structure.</p>\n<p>In WordPress visual editor you can add headings under <strong>Paragraph</strong> dropdown. In there you have choices to select <strong>headings hierarchy</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heading 1 (H1).</li>\n<li>Heading 2 (H2).</li>\n<li>Heading 3 (H3).</li>\n<li>And so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are couple of important notes how to use headings correctly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not use Heading 1</strong>. In most cases Heading 1 comes from your theme template file automatically. It&#8217;s not the end of the world use two Heading 1 in the same page but this is my recommendation.</li>\n<li><strong>You can use Heading 2</strong> and Heading 3 as a sub heading. In most cases there is no need for heading 4, 5, or 6.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not skip heading levels</strong>. After H2 comes H3. After that H4 and so on. This is important for semantic hierarchy of a page. Screen reader users can scan the content by using headings hierarchy.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not use text formatting to replace actual headings</strong>, like font size, colour or bold. They are not structural elements. Search engines and assistive technology users can&#8217;t read them in the same way as headings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read article <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/\">Semantic Structure from WebAIM</a> for more information. You can check your page heading structure with these tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi?hl=en\">Headings Map toolbar for Chrome</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/headingsmap/\">Headings Map toolbar for Firefox</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>How about other editor tools than headings? Which one are good and which one not so good.</p>\n<h2>Emphasizing content</h2>\n<p>Screen readers and search engines don&#8217;t understand bold, italic, underline, or colour. Therefore don&#8217;t use them as only way to indicate importance or hierarchy of your text. Here is my list what you should avoid and why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not underline text</strong>. Most people think that underlined text is a link. Underlined text doesn&#8217;t have semantic meaning for screen reader users.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not justify text</strong>. This can result big gaps between the words and bad reading experience. Luckily <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-removes-the-underline-and-justify-buttons-from-the-editor\">Underline and Justify buttons was removed from the WordPress editor</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not change text colour</strong>. This can lead to inconsistency design in your site. Leave all the colour styling for the theme you&#8217;re using.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not capitalize text</strong>. In general CAPITALIZED TEXT is difficult to read and some screen readers read capitalized text letter by letter. Who wants to shout at their readers anyways. 🎧 🙃</li>\n<li>Be also careful when aligning text to center, right, or left. For example if you end up centering all the headings you&#8217;re in trouble. Also that styling should be done in theme styles for consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Making accessible links</h2>\n<p>Links are the back bone of the web. Sitepoint have good article about <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/15-rules-making-accessible-links/\">creating accessible links</a>. I highlight some of them here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link text should provide clear information about the meaning of a link.</li>\n<li>Avoid repetitive link text like &#8220;Click here&#8221; or &#8220;Learn more&#8221;.\n<ul>\n<li>That&#8217;s just bad language.</li>\n<li>Screen reader users can navigate your page using links only. For them repetitive &#8220;Click here&#8221; link doesn&#8217;t give any information what the link is about.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Avoid using URLs as link text.\n<ul>\n<li>Some screen readers read URL links letter by letter.</li>\n<li>Bad example: <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/busting-myths-accessibility/\">https://foxland.foxnet.fi/busting-myths-accessibility/ </a></li>\n<li>Good example: <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/busting-myths-accessibility/\">Busting the Myths of Accessibility</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use Title attributes in links. Screen readers and touch devices don&#8217;t see them. Title attribute fields is also removed from the WordPress link modal box.</li>\n<li>Avoid opening links in new window or tab.\n<ul>\n<li>Assistive technology users might get confused what just happened.</li>\n<li>Can be problematic in mobile browsers to go back where you started.</li>\n<li>Users can open links in new window or tab if they want.</li>\n<li>If you want to open external links in new window, always notify users about that. Such as additional text &#8220;opens in new window&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Image alternative text</h2>\n<p>Screen readers and search engines can&#8217;t really know what the images presents. Alternative text provides a textual information or functionality of images:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s read by screen readers and search engines in place of images.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s displayed in place of the image if the user have chosen not to show images or images are not loaded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But what is alternative text?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s <code>alt</code> attribute of the image. In WordPress image modal this is called alt text.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s the context or surroundings of the image, like caption.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have to admit that I struggle to write good alt attribute or caption for images. That&#8217;s why I always read WebAIM wonderful article of <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/\">appropriate use of alternative text</a> over and over again. There are examples about alt attribute usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alt attribute depends on the context. That why it&#8217;s so hard!</li>\n<li>Every image must have an alt attribute. If you remove alt attribute all together screen readers try to read &#8220;something&#8221;, like filename.</li>\n<li>But alt attribute can be empty (<code>alt=\"\"</code>) for decorative images.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other media like videos and PDFs</h2>\n<p>For videos it&#8217;s good to have captions or transcript available. Not all people can  see or hear. Note that captions are not the same thing as subtitles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subtitles are a direct translation of the speech.</li>\n<li>Captions are a text version of the speech and sound on the video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From my understanding PDF files are not very accessible. I have read about PDF tags which provides a hidden structured, textual representation of the PDF content that is presented to screen readers.</p>\n<p>For more information here is fantastic <a href=\"https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2017/02/pdf-inaccessibility/\">overview of PDF inaccessibility</a>, what PDF files actually are, and what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes.</p>\n<h2>Talk in Jyväskylä WordPress meetup</h2>\n<p>This article was written for my talk in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Jyvaskyla-WordPress-Meetup/events/233567475/\">Jyväskylä WordPress meetup</a>. That&#8217;s why the article is more like &#8220;slides&#8221; of my talk with lot&#8217;s of bullet points, sorry about that. But I do hope you got some tips how to write accessible content.

Go to that site when you have crappy monitor, bad eyesight, or you are just getting old.

But this article is not about forks.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s about how _s can continue being the greatest starter theme out there</strong>.</p>\n<p>Remember that _s is <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> product and some (or many) of the decision are not on community hands. But if you ask me it needs same kind attention than default themes like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/\">Twenty Seventeen</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is my short list how we can improve _s theme development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After every default theme we should look what issues was inherited from <code>_s</code> theme and fix them. Otherwise all the issues are inherited for all new themes generated from _s.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/issues\">Issues</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pulls\">pull requests</a> should be reviewed and discussed more frequently. I don&#8217;t even know who have access the repo, and that&#8217;s one of the problems. Transparency is always good.</li>\n<li>There should be several people who takes the main lead reviewing and discussing issues and PRs.</li>\n<li>Main lead could rotate in month period. And main lead would check the repo every week, or every other week.</li>\n<li>Checking the repo could mean active discussion, testing the PRs, closing the issues, calling for help and second opinions and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But who is we, and who can be the main lead?</p>\n<p>By we I mean the community who are opening the issues, making PRs, discussing, testing, and making Underscores better. Main leaders probably needs to work for Automattic. But that&#8217;s okay as long as there is clear road map.</p>\n<p>I personally try to contribute to _s theme as often I see issues. Let me know if you have other ideas how we could improve _s theme development. And have a great year 2017!</p>\n","<p>Underscores is one of the best starter themes out there.

Joe Dolson have written article about <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2013/07/designing-accessible-navigation/\">designing accessible navigation</a> and it sums the definition very well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works without Javascript and CSS (screen readers, search engine bots).</li>\n<li>Works for users with difficulty reading text.</li>\n<li>Works for users with difficulty seeing low-contrast colors or certain color contrast.</li>\n<li>Works using keyboard only.</li>\n<li>Works on “every” device and screen size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my opinion &#8220;do nothing&#8221; approach is the most accessible navigation pattern. It easily qualifies all the accessible menu definitions and doesn&#8217;t need any extra work from the user. Or from the developer.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;do nothing&#8221; menu you just show the menu items all the time. There is no hamburger menu toggle buttons or any other extra steps to access menu items.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6451\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6451 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Themehybrid-1024x643.jpg\" alt=\"themehybrid accessible menu\" width=\"1024\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Themehybrid-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Themehybrid-300x188.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Themehybrid-768x482.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Themehybrid.jpg 1208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Accessible menu in <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">ThemeHybrid</a> site.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Remember Color Contrast</h2>\n<p>Be careful with background images and color contrast in responsive design. It can be really hard to see white text on white background.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6446\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Color_Contrast-1024x235.jpg\" alt=\"color contrast on background image and text is not good\" width=\"1024\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Color_Contrast-1024x235.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Color_Contrast-300x69.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Color_Contrast-768x176.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Color_Contrast.jpg 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Note that above image is not what we used on live site 🙂 As a solution use dark color overlay on image. Or put dark background on text.</p>\n<h2>Other design related notes</h2>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZwLx_FAIGrcg_Mvzcb70cc13oBL0CYkZnM8m5nmKy8/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000#slide=id.gefa95a7c4_0_19\">slides</a> there are lot&#8217;s of technical stuff (but not in &#8220;do nothing&#8221; menu) you need to take care when building accessible menu. But here here are couple of notes about the design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6447\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dropdown-1024x201.jpg\" alt=\"dropdown navigation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dropdown-1024x201.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dropdown-300x59.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dropdown-768x151.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dropdown.jpg 1213w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Should there be arrow icon as a dropdown indicator? I&#8217;d say yes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6450\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mobile_toggle_button.jpg\" alt=\"mobile toggle button designs\" width=\"698\" height=\"161\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mobile_toggle_button.jpg 698w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mobile_toggle_button-300x69.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /></p>\n<p>Mobile toggle button design is sometimes hard. Even if I would prefer to just have the text open/close menu, it can be hard to fit to design on other languages. You know because of the long long words. New generation probably understands hamburger menu without any label but here are couple of interesting posts to read.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/\">Hamburger Menus and Hidden Navigation Hurt UX Metrics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jamesarcher.me/the-hamburger-menu/\">The Hamburger Menu Doesn&#8217;t Work</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d say there is use case for every menu toggle design. It depends is boring answer but that&#8217;s all I got.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>. Note that there is new recommended method using <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/#controls\">menu toggle button</a> like this: <code>&lt;button class=\"menu-toggle\" type=\"button\"&gt;Menu&lt;/button&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Notice the attribute <code>type=\"button\"</code> there. Here is explanation from <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a> why:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It means a button with no additional semantics: e.g., not a submit or reset button. It means that the button won&#8217;t do anything if your JS events don&#8217;t fire &#8211; e.g., no need for preventDefault, because there&#8217;s no default action.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For more technical details <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZwLx_FAIGrcg_Mvzcb70cc13oBL0CYkZnM8m5nmKy8/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000#slide=id.gefa95a7c4_0_19\">check the designing accessible navigation slides</a>.

He has been building beautiful and easy to use themes for a long time. And he knows about theme business. First I encourage you to listen Matt Report&#8217;s interview <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/start-wordpress-theme-business-mike-mcalister/\">how to start WordPress Theme business</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>Then come back to read insights of <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/\">Array Themes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Who is behind Array Themes and what is the history about Array Themes?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/\">Array Themes</a> is an independent theme shop focused on finely-crafted WordPress themes that solve problems for all kinds of creative folks. We value quality over quantity,</p>\n<p>Array is run by myself (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister\">Mike McAlister</a>) and my coworker and fellow coffee junkie, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/John_Parris\">John Parris</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2009, I transitioned from client work into creating commercial WordPress themes and started a little theme shop called Okay Themes. For the first couple years, I sold my WordPress themes through ThemeForest, which was still new and thriving at the time. Selling on such a large marketplace taught me how to create products for a mass market and how to work with customers to find solutions for their website needs.</p>\n<p>Selling on a marketplace like ThemeForest also has its drawbacks. There’s a lot more direct competition, it’s harder to set yourself apart, and you have to operate within the conditions of the marketplace, which can be confining. It was clear, even in 2014, that theme marketplaces were changing quickly and all-in-one WordPress themes were sweeping the industry.</p>\n<p>I had no intentions (and still have no intentions) of making these kinds of themes, as they go against my ethos of creating products that solve more problems than they create.</p>\n<p>I decided to focus on relaunching Okay Themes as Array Themes, an independent theme shop dedicated to finely-crafted, well-designed WordPress themes. This rebrand helped us distinguish Array as it’s own brand and open up our collection to a wider audience with more opportunities. At the same time, I started working with the folks at WordPress.com to provide Array Themes to their massive audience.</p>\n<p>Currently, you can find Array Themes on <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/\">Array</a>, <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/array/\">WordPress.com</a> and <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/user/arraythemes/portfolio\">ThemeForest</a>.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6431\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6431\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6431 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Array_Themes_are_ok-1024x907.jpg\" alt=\"Array Themes are ok\" width=\"1024\" height=\"907\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Array_Themes_are_ok-1024x907.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Array_Themes_are_ok-300x266.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Array_Themes_are_ok-768x680.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Array_Themes_are_ok.jpg 1091w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Array Themes are more than Okay</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In general, we try to make themes that are incredibly easy to use. Themes have grown to be monstrous in features and plugin-territory functionality, but we’re dedicated to keeping site creation very simple for our users, as it should be.</p>\n<p>Instead of requiring the user to build the site themselves with page builders that never quite deliver what they promise, we do the heavy lifting by designing the theme inside and out, making sure everything is pixel perfect.</p>\n<p>The end result is a theme that works out of the box, where you can simply plug in your content and get a beautiful website.</p>\n<p>As far as the style of our themes, we make themes for creative folks of all kinds. Whether you’re an artist, a photographer, a writer, a designer or a small business, we have themes that will get you up and running with an awesome website in no time.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m inspired by photography and typography, so Array’s theme designs tend to focus on those elements. With our latest theme, Lenscap, we’ve started working with WooCommerce, so you can expect to see some more WooCommerce themes soon.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6427\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero.jpg\" alt=\"lenscap theme screenshot\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero.jpg 900w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-150x150.jpg 150w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-300x300.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-768x768.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-680x680.jpg 680w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-100x100.jpg 100w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lenscap-hero-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/lenscap-wordpress-theme/\">Lenscap</a> is our latest magazine and eCommerce theme. Lenscap makes it super easy to create a stunning WordPress-powered magazine and online store with slick content discovery features, gallery and video post styles, smart customization options and WooCommerce support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/baseline-wordpress-theme/\">Baseline</a> is a minimal, magazine-style theme with support for large, beautiful featured images. We’ve combined some next-level design, pixel-perfect typography and slick content discovery features in Baseline. With multiple layouts and smart customization options, you can create a stunning magazine or digital content website in minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/\">Checkout</a> is a theme that integrates closely with EasyDigitalDownloads, allowing you to create your own digital goods shop or start a vendor marketplace. Because Checkout is optimized to work with many of the EasyDigitalDownloads plugins, this theme is a powerful turn-key solution to selling your goods online.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>I’ve found that my inspiration often comes from more abstract sources like colors, architecture, photography, typography and industrial design. Fortunately, I have no shortage of ideas for themes and other product designs I’d like to make, the problem is not having enough time to make everything!</p>\n<p>I have lots of little bits of design floating around in my head, so when the time comes to create a new design, I just grab inspiration from what’s going on around me and try to put those elements into a cohesive design.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy?</h2>\n<p>Our themes can currently be found at <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/wordpress-themes/\">Array</a>, <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/array/\">WordPress.com</a> and <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/user/arraythemes/portfolio\">ThemeForest</a>. On our site, customers have the option of buying a single theme for $49, or they can get a <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/theme-club/\">Theme Club</a> membership, which unlocks all of our themes for only $89 per year.</p>\n<p>This is the most popular option and we’ve created several opportunities, both pre-purchase and post-purchase, for customers to upgrade into the Theme Club.</p>\n<p>Customers can also download our <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/category/free/\">free Theme Pack</a>, which is a mini bundle of five of our themes. This is a good way to get a feel for the quality and ease-of-use of our themes before you join the Theme Club.</p>\n<p>We also have a theme on WordPress.org called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/editor/\">Editor</a>, which continues to be one of our top ten sources for traffic to Array.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>Since we launched Array as an independent theme shop, we’ve seen healthy and consistent growth (~30%) from year to year. <strong>Sales on our site are now the biggest source of income for the business</strong>, beating out both WordPress.com and ThemeForest (most months). We’ll continue to build on this growth and look for more opportunities to reach more folks with our theme collection.</p>\n<p>Changing to a subscription model last year has made a significant impact on recurring revenue, adding a ~25% increase to our monthly revenue. I only wish I had done it a few years earlier!</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>I don’t have a go-to base theme that I use for starting new themes, rather I build off of a theme that’s recently been coded, reviewed and released. This cuts down development time and let’s us focus on the design and how it should function.</p>\n<p>Generally, I have an idea of what the next theme is going to be, so I’m always thinking ahead about the design. I’ll do a little sketching here and there, mock-up a page or two in Photoshop and then hit the ground running with code.</p>\n<p>Both John and I use Sublime as our main code editor. We use Grunt to handle several tasks during development, such as compiling Sass, cleaning up CSS and adding prefixes when necessary. We’ve created a few custom tools to help with theme management and deployment.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>Array is going to continue cranking away at making themes, branching out into a few different niches. There’s a ton of opportunity in a platform that powers a quarter of the web, and we plan on exploring a few different avenues that are not theme related. And we’re going to eat a lot of pizza, too.</p>\n<p>I don’t really see themes changing drastically in the near future. The REST API will be a great tool for custom applications, but there’s a lot of work to do before themes can responsibly take advantage of the API and have a broad commercial appeal.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/array-redesign-survey-results/\">Array ran a survey</a> to gain feedback about our upcoming redesign and to generally see where our customers’ needs were. When we asked our users what was most important to them when looking for a new WordPress theme, <strong>Design was the overwhelming response over Code Quality</strong>, Theme Options and Ease of Use.</p>\n<p>Personally, I expected to see a lot of votes for Theme Options, but perhaps users are seeking simpler solutions again.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’d love to see more theme developers focus on design, or employ those who have an appreciation and skill for design. It’s easy to offloaded the responsibility of making design decisions by replacing them with theme options or support for site builders, but this is only solving half the problem for your customers. WordPress is at its best when you can fire it up, put your content in the post editor, hit publish and get back to life.</p>\n<p>WordPress theme developers are responsible for the appearance of so many websites on the internet, approximately 26.6% of the web! This is a great opportunity to shape, or rather reshape, the aesthetic that is associated with WordPress-based products.</p>\n","<p>It&#8217;s time for another WordPress Theme Shop interview with Mike McAlister.

I purchased the site in 2014 from Tung and have updated a lot of the older themes and released a few new ones.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p>The themes are general purpose blog and portfolio themes.

Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6374\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cascade-Theme-Screenshot-1024x553.jpg\" alt=\"Cascade Theme Screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cascade-Theme-Screenshot-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cascade-Theme-Screenshot-300x162.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cascade-Theme-Screenshot-768x415.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cascade-Theme-Screenshot.jpg 1671w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devpress.com/products/gather/\">Gather</a> is the best selling theme on the site and also one of the my favorites. If you look close, DevPress itself uses a modified version of Gather. I also use it as a general blog theme on WP Theming. But it&#8217;s designed to be a portfolio type theme, and it&#8217;s been really neat to see the work people showcase with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devpress.com/products/cascade/\">Cascade</a> is a general blog theme original designed and developed by Tung Do. I refreshed the codebase and added some new features when I took over DevPress. Minimalist designs are really difficult to do well, even though they appear simple when done right. I think Tung made a lot of great typography, spacing, and subtle color palette choices with this theme and it really presents content well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devpress.com/products/luminate/\">Luminate</a> is intended for a basic brochure or business site. This is a layout that is on at least a million sites: menu, main feature block, 3-4 secondary feature blocks, footer. However, I was developing a site for a former client and couldn&#8217;t find any themes that had this layout and were also well-coded and easy to customize. Since I&#8217;ve built Luminate I&#8217;ve used it as a base for at least five other client sites- it saves a ton of time to have solid theme to build on.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6376\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gather-Theme-Screenshot-1024x712.jpg\" alt=\"Gather Theme Screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"712\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gather-Theme-Screenshot-1024x712.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gather-Theme-Screenshot-300x208.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gather-Theme-Screenshot-768x534.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gather-Theme-Screenshot.jpg 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://devpress.com/products/gather/\">Gather</a> started with a bit of inspiration from branding I saw of the &#8217;68 Olympics in Mexico City. I really wanted to do something with brighter colors, and was looking at color palettes in Mexico when I across the work of Lance Wyman. I loved the use of geometric lines in the Olympics and eventually used a similar font for the large branding text. I also like to browse <a href=\"https://www.siteinspire.com/\">Site Inspire</a> to see what&#8217;s popular with new sites.</p>\n<p>In terms of code, I follow a lot of great people on Twitter and also keep up with developments in Core. That allows me to take advantage of new features as soon as they are released in WordPress and also share them with others.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy?</h2>\n<p>After working on DevPress for a year, I realized marketing was something I needed more experience with. That&#8217;s partially why I took a full-time job as a growth engineer with Cratejoy. It&#8217;s not enough to just release a great product, you also need to help people to find it. Selling themes for $49 also doesn&#8217;t really give you a lot of margin if you need to pay out affiliates, do paid advertising, or hire someone to write content.</p>\n<p>At the moment I sell one theme on WordPress.com and the rest directly through DevPress. I&#8217;m also planning to release some of the themes for free on wordpress.org. But marketing is something I definitely need to improve for the site.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>DevPress brought in about $15k of revenue last year. It&#8217;s not enough to revenue to be full time, but I enjoy working on it as a side project. I also work with <a href=\"https://cratejoy.com\">Cratejoy</a>, a small startup in Austin, as a growth engineer.</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>The newer themes have all been forked off <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a>. I use Grunt for the build tools and styles are written is sass. I generally start with a design concept and then build it out directly in the browser.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with React some, but it&#8217;s probably too early for building commercial projects with it as plugin support would be really difficult. I&#8217;ve also been thinking more about the idea of niche themes which provide an entire solution for specific industries and moving to a monthly fee model- but don&#8217;t have any immediate plans to move in that direction.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage theme developers to get involved with the theme review team on wordpress.org. It is a great way to learn good coding standards and contribute back to the community. I think it&#8217;s also really valuable to share what you learn- no matter what level you&#8217;re at. I&#8217;ve been posting about theme development on <a href=\"http://wptheming.com/\">WP Theming</a> for years and it&#8217;s been a terrific way to engage with other developers and get feedback for ideas I&#8217;ve been working on.</p>\n","<p>Next WordPress theme shop interview is from Devin Price who runs DevPress. Devin also writes excellent articles about themes and development in WP Theming site. DevPress has long history with couple of different ownership but quality has stayed super high. In this interview Devin talks about his journey and DevPress. I really liked the Gather theme inspiration part for example.

Did you guess that they build Church themes? This is perfect example how you build themes around niche like churches.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been following (not stalking!) Steven Gliebe for several years, and for a good reason. He is one of the first pioneers who understood that functionality like custom post types should be in a plugin, not in a theme. That&#8217;s why he build <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/\">Church Theme Content Plugin</a>. He&#8217;s combination of themes and plugins is the right way to go.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy that Steven shared history, present, and the future of churchthemes.com. </p>\n<h2>Who is behind churchthemes.com and what is the history about churchthemes.com?</h2>\n<p>I, Steven Gliebe, began making WordPress themes in 2011. My second attempt was for churches. I saw on ThemeForest that there were only about 10 church themes and that all did pretty well in terms of sales. As a Christian, I was excited about the possibility of tackling this niche. After several months of toil, my Risen theme was hard rejected. I was discouraged but eventually managed to get it approved and to date it has sold more than 7,000 copies. It was one of the weekly top sellers on ThemeForest for a while.</p>\n<p>The success of that theme made it clear to me that there was a real market for church WordPress themes so I set out to start a theme shop catering specifically to churches. I made an offer for <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a> and was able to acquire it (interestingly, from the same person who used to own the famous <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/\">wptavern.com</a> domain). This was at about the same time that <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> began to take off. Its software licensing add-on was exactly what I needed to build a theme shop.</p>\n<p>Building and supporting church WordPress themes has been my primary work since 2012 and I have no plans to stop. I love working with churches to help them build effective websites.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p>Risen was designed primarily for churches but also made in a way that it could be useful for other purposes (ie. renaming sermons to something else via an option). I found myself supporting customers making websites in realms I&#8217;m not so familiar with and that was really not what I set out to do. I thought I could get more sales that way but it wasn&#8217;t worth it.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a>, the themes are more rigid in that they are even more specifically for churches. By doing this, I&#8217;m able to provide a more focused solution with better results. And of all the different types of customers I&#8217;ve worked with, my favorite is the small church pastor building the website himself. Some are total beginners, others are bonafide developers. I love them all.</p>\n<p>All of the themes sold at <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">Church Theme Content</a> plugin which I developed for myself and other church theme developers to use. It helps churches switch between themes made by various providers by handling all post type and taxonomy registration and by providing custom fields.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Maranatha-1024x589.jpg\" alt=\"Maranatha theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"589\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6261\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Maranatha-1024x589.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Maranatha-300x172.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Maranatha-768x441.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Maranatha.jpg 1496w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>The latest is <a href=\"https://churchthemes.com/themes/maranatha/\">Maranatha</a>. I try to make each theme substantially <a href=\"https://churchthemes.com/2015/11/30/maranatha-beautifully-innovative-new-theme/\">different</a> from the last in order to offer a broad selection of themes. My goal is to have at least one option that is appealing to every church. With Maranatha, I did some things that I think were pretty bold. It might be the only church theme without a slider or sidebar. I found good reasons to ditch / replace these things.</p>\n<p>Instead of a slider, the homepage has sections the visitor can scroll through. It&#8217;s the same content you&#8217;d normally see in a slider but presented in a manner more likely to be seen by the user. The fact is that today&#8217;s users scroll, they don&#8217;t cycle through slides. I observed that churches mostly use a sidebar to list things like taxonomy terms. Knowing that, I made automatic dropdowns at the top of each section for sermon topics, event categories, etc. Less configuration, more space.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t plan on bringing the slider or sidebar back for future themes. It turned out that choosing what is useful over what is popular didn&#8217;t hurt sales. It was a great discovery and very liberating.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>For code, I&#8217;ve been influenced a lot by <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/\">Justin Tadlock</a> and <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/\">Pippin Williamson</a>. I learned by Justin&#8217;s example where post types belong and how to avoid <a href=\"https://churchthemes.com/2014/05/27/wordpress-theme-users-avoid-lock-in-effect/\">theme lock-in</a>. I structured my church theme framework to some degree after his Hybrid Core framework. Pippin helped me realize what a mistake it was to have added shortcodes to my first theme. I had unfortunately been mimicking common practices on ThemeForest at the time instead of learning WordPress development standards. When I started working on <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a> in 2012, I did my best to start things off the right way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Exodus-1024x582.jpg\" alt=\"Churchthemes Exodus theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6263\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Exodus-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Exodus-300x170.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Exodus-768x436.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Churchthemes_Exodus.jpg 1748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>As for design, I just take note of beautiful sites when I happen upon them. I keep a file and periodically log a website into it with a note pointing out some aspect of the design that I think is beautiful or useful. I try not to look much at the competition. I don&#8217;t want to be influenced by them. I want to be different. I have enough feedback from church customers to know what their needs are.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy?</h2>\n<p>I only sell on <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a> (apart from my first theme which remains on ThemeForest). I&#8217;m not a fan of the sell here, there and everywhere approach. That&#8217;s too complicated for me. Too many places to check up on, too many different ways to handle support, too many requirements of marketplaces. It also encourages customers to go back not just to the theme maker but to the marketplace. Why lead customers back to your competition?</p>\n<p>I decided to build my own brand and run my own business instead. I have total control to do what I think is best with pricing, licensing, renewals, updates, guides, support, refunds, etc. I don&#8217;t have to risk working for months on a theme only to have it rejected. I don&#8217;t need approval to release an update. The cut marketplaces take is fair. I spend about the same maintaining and marketing my own shop, but I love the freedom and not found it to be less profitable flying solo.</p>\n<p>As for marketing, I&#8217;ve had an affiliate program from the start. I found people who were already marketing church themes and asked to be included. This really helped get the ball rolling for me and the great thing about affiliate marketing is that you pay only when you make a sale. It&#8217;s really hard to waste money compared to something like Google AdWords or buying ads on social media. Now most sales come organically from Google and via referrals from other churches.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t experimented with free themes but I would like to test those waters. My plugin is free with a paid add-on so I should be able to make a very simple free church theme and get some exposure on WordPress.org. We&#8217;ll see how that goes. I know it works for some but not others. In any case, it would be nice to be able to help churches that are overdue for a new website but can&#8217;t fit it into their budget just yet.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>My church themes business has done better each year since I started it. More than 10,000 churches have used my themes. I&#8217;ve been able to make a full-time living from it, something I&#8217;m grateful for.</p>\n<p>Another number is 30% which is about how much of the total revenue is from renewals. That&#8217;s with charging 50% renewal annually. While I believe this can and should be improved (ie. enabling automatic renewal), it&#8217;s a significant portion. This would not have been possible had I stuck with ThemeForest since they provide lifetime access to updates, which in my experience shoots renewals in the foot. It feels great to have resources to improve existing products, support my customers and take my time doing my best with new themes. No mad rush to keep the boat afloat while putting quality or service in peril.</p>\n<p>I make it a point to always have a side business. I don&#8217;t believe in keeping all my eggs in one basket. With that said, I&#8217;ve found having too many side-projects to be a burden. I recently sold <a href=\"http://hostingreviews.io/\">HostingReviews.io</a> and <a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/\">Pro Plugin Directory</a> to focus more on<a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a>. I&#8217;m readying <a href=\"https://wpchurchhost.com/\">WP Church Host</a> with the help of <a href=\"https://www.pressed.net/\">Pressed</a> to compliment my primary work with churches. I have a business that is entirely unrelated to churches and WordPress. It&#8217;s what I was focused on before making WordPress themes. Maybe I&#8217;ll share it when I get rid of that circa-2007 look. Ancient.</p>\n<p><H2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>I spend couple weeks in Photoshop. Once I&#8217;m happy with a design, I fork my last theme then hack the markup and CSS to match what I came up with in Photoshop. This is feasible since they are all church themes and have mostly the same features, use the same framework and the same plugin. Then, I test like crazy, fix issues, test like crazy again, make the demo and produce sample content files from the demo. After that, I launch and market. It probably takes me 4 &#8211; 6 months to completely launch a new church theme.</p>\n<p>I use a WordPress multisite install on <a href=\"https://serverpress.com/get-desktopserver/\">DesktopServer</a> for local development and Git for versioning. Sublime Text is my editor of choice. I&#8217;m a <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> convert and use <a href=\"http://livereload.com/\">LiveReload</a>. <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">Browserstack</a> definitely comes in handy and of course the Theme Check plugin is a must. My rig is a MacBook Pro hooked up to a 27&#8243; Thunderbolt display. I am personally powered by a variety of beans and water. Sometimes pizza.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>I plan on staying the course. There&#8217;s a lot more I want to do with <a href=\"http://churchthemes.com/\">churchthemes.com</a>. I have plans for more themes and add-ons. I intend to adjust my marketing efforts and reach out more to churches wanting a website in general rather than those who specifically want a WordPress theme. WordPress may be the most popular CMS by far but most websites aren&#8217;t using it, which I see as an opportunity. Based on customer feedback, I also intend to switch to a membership model in which churches and professionals who build sites for churches can get access to all themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Themes changing direction? I think there has been a slow progression towards standards in commercial themes. From what I understand, ThemeForest has been moving in the right direction on this. They have a lot of influence. Design trends aside, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see major change in the direction of theming any time soon. There is a lot of talk about how the theme market is saturated and money can&#8217;t be made anymore. If that&#8217;s the case then maybe we&#8217;ll see more niche theme shops pop up. There are not too many right now, which has surprised me.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>For users, go to Sami&#8217;s list of <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wordpress-theme-shops-trust/\">trusted theme shops</a>. I find it hard myself to know where to find quality made themes. It&#8217;s a very helpful list.</p>\n<p>I have these suggestions for other theme developers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow WordPress development standards. Find out what it takes to get accepted on WordPress.org and if your commercial theme does not meet those guidelines, fix it. Your customers will thank you in the long run.</li>\n<li>Aim to solve specific problems more than mimicking what&#8217;s popular. Don&#8217;t blindly copy what the best sellers are doing. Ask yourself, will this actually benefit the user? Is this really necessary? You&#8217;ll set yourself apart by doing that.</li>\n<li>Focus on an uncommon niche (ie. not portfolio themes) that you have a passion for. If you really know the needs of your customers, you&#8217;re in a position to solve their problems in a market that likely has relatively little competition, at least at the price point that is possible with WordPress. You&#8217;ve got to have a passion for the niche so you don&#8217;t burn out.</li>\n<li>Use a sustainable business model. Don&#8217;t offer unlimited or lifetime support or updates. Make sure you get paid for ongoing development and support or you&#8217;ll risk tanking down the road. It has become common to charge a renewal fee for access to updates and support, usually discounted by 20% to 50%. The Easy Digital Downloads Software Licensing add-on can handle this for you. You&#8217;ll thank yourself after two or three years.</li>\n<li>If you will fly solo rather than beginning with ThemeForest, start an affiliate program. Search for posts listing themes in your niche and ask to be included. Some will, some wont. If you ask 50 and only 20 do it, you&#8217;re likely to get some sales. Keep this up indefinitely so that customers who don&#8217;t find you directly on Google will find you indirectly.</li>\n<li>Include a &#8220;Powered by&#8221; link in your theme footer with a setting to remove / change it. I&#8217;ve found that most keep it and that it generates a surprising percentage of sales. People needing a new website look at their competitors&#8217; websites. I&#8217;m basing this on what I&#8217;ve seen with churches. Mileage may vary.</li>\n<li>Join <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/club/\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://poststatus.com/club/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1470983631059000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMQ1h8RhHH41kWqsq7n6SV6bexKA\">Post Status Club</a> and hop on Slack to learn from and network with other theme shop owners.</li>\n</ul>\n","<p>Next WordPress theme shop interview is from churchthemes.com.

It&#8217;s a matter of opportunity, present personal interests, and overall portfolio structure.</p>\n<p>That is why the multi-purpose themes were off our table from the very beginning and thankfully we&#8217;ve stayed the course. We considered them the death of elegance, value, and fun. So, no thank you.</p>\n<p>Now regarding our target audience, we have managed to define 3 main segments: creative people/entrepreneurs (photographers, visual artists, journalists), local small businesses (restaurants, coffee/tea shops, small boutique shops) and hobby-driven people (personal bloggers, travelers).</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6209\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-1024x511.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"511\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6209\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-300x150.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-768x384.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-1240x620.jpg 1240w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa-1080x540.jpg 1080w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rosa.jpg 1904w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rosa WordPress Theme</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now this is a hard one. It&#8217;s like asking a parent who is your favorite child. But since deep down everyone has a certain soft spot (even parents 🙂 ), I will highlight <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/item/rosa-an-exquisite-restaurant-wordpress-theme/7920093\">Rosa</a> and <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/themes/patch/\">Patch</a>.</p>\n<p>Rosa is one of our most succesful themes (certainly the most profitable). It is a theme targeted at the small local restaurant or coffee/tea shop, catered for their presentation needs with some business focuse functionality (like the integration with OpenTable for reservations).</p>\n<p>The driving force behind it&#8217;s success (and its coolness) is it&#8217;s ease of use (by sticking to WordPress standards in terms of workflows) and the great (and flexible) design of the hero area + content blocks. One thing we are especially proud about Rosa is the buttery smooth parallax effect we&#8217;ve managed to achieve. It wasn&#8217;t an easy task but we believe we&#8217;ve struck a good balance.</p>\n<p>Patch is quite a different theme from Rosa in terms of targeting: it is a blogging theme with a magazine touch. Blogging is often underrated among theme authors since it is seen as a core functionality, hence it is hard to project value from it; you can&#8217;t brag with over-the-top functionality; you have less elements to play around.</p>\n<p>We believe these constraints are actually a great opportunity to focus more on each element of the design ( #constraintsareliberating ). Patch is a wonderful example of this getting-back-to-basics with it&#8217;s clever masonry grid that uses the post&#8217;s data (title, featured image, post format) to allow for exciting layout &#8220;accidents&#8221; while keeping an overall balance.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>Design inspiration is everywhere: from personal passions and interests, other designers we follow, the content we read, movies we see, artists we appreciate, stuff we happen to encounter in our travels, to the people we meet (their own passions and work). Our designers just have to capture something from this fuzzy blob and compress it to a product that delivers value to our customers. Easy right? 🙂</p>\n<p>Code inspiration (though we seldom use the term inspiration for code &#8211; learning, research, problem-solving would more often be on our minds) comes from the WordPress.org standards, great developers that constantly push things forward with their purposeful perspective and witt (think the ones working at the likes of Automattic, 10up, Human Made, Delicious Brains, etc.). We also try and find inspiration in one another, each having a different background and particular way of tackling a problem.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>Currently, we are <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/user/pixelgrade/portfolio\">exclusive authors on ThemeForest</a> (this is where we&#8217;ve started our premium WordPress themes journey), we sell themes on WordPress.com and our own shop; the themes sold on WordPress.com are also present on our shop (WP.com being a service where one can&#8217;t download it&#8217;s theme and they also don&#8217;t impose exclusivity).</p>\n<p>We have had some experiments with free themes on WordPress.org (one of them being a lite version of a theme on our shop) but they are not our main driving force. Most of our clients come due to the traffic generated by the 2 marketplaces, plus our own efforts of marketing (centered on getting theme reviews and social media attention).</p>\n<p>We are currently in the process of reestablishing our strategy on more solid foundations: we are working on a new shop (a proper shop) that will allow us to better focus our efforts and better serve our clients. We will still be authors on ThemeForest and WP.com but a larger part of our efforts will be directed to our own shop.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>For quite a while, we&#8217;ve been very transparent with our numbers through our semestrial <a href=\"https://medium.com/search?q=pixelgrade%20transparency%20report\">Transparency Reports</a>. Overall we are doing great, at least to our standards, with a few ups and downs here and there (just to keep us on our toes). Numbers wise, our latest report puts us at a $57,933 monthly average income with $33,750 in monthly expenses.</p>\n<p>As for other businesses, no, we don&#8217;t have any. We put all our collective efforts into PixelGrade.</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think we are doing anything out of the ordinary. Maybe the fact that we self-impose tight new themes release schedules; we usually aim for 6-8 weeks for a new theme starting from the moment the designers get to work until we put it up for sale. This way we are forced to trim off the &#8220;fat&#8221; and produce a lean theme with maximum value for our customers. We start our themes from _s (again to keep it low fat) and we use SCSS for all of our CSS needs.</p>\n<p>As developement tools go, we are also within the norm, I think: our trusty Macs, Sketch, PHPStorm, Sublime Text, Chrome, GitHub, Pressmatic (more recently for local environment).</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>For theme users/buyers, I would urge them to consider very carefully their needs (or their business needs) and focus on getting the theme that manages to fulfill them (preferably just them) in a clear and thoughtful manner. The closer your needs and the theme&#8217;s offer are, the more value you will get and the happier everyone will be. Oh, and keep the theme&#8217;s price on the very bottom of your concerns list; you are in for a bargain no matter what theme you pick; just make sure it is the right bargain for you.</p>\n<p>As for theme developers, one thing: go out, team up with good designers, and become theme authors. This is the only way you will remain relevant for the medium term. Functionality alone can be easily copied and commoditized, design with a rock-solid functional foundation not so much. Oh, and let us all unite and kill the multi-purpose theme 🙂</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>Some of the business plans I have already described in terms of a new shop and a new playground. As for the future of themes (and WordPress to some extent), I strongly believe we will soon enter a post-crisis situation (I believe we are currently in a silent crisis) where customers will better understand the value that needs to be delivered by a theme (and what by plugins) and authors will start to think more in terms of product (and the experience associated with it) and less in terms of code. This will be a far more healthy space to work, grow and attract new talent.</p>\n","<p>Have you ever watched the Bold and the Beautiful soap opera?

I wish I could play in a band. Heck, I wish I was running <a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/\">AudioTheme</a>! They provide WordPress solutions for artists and musicians. This is the place where you should start searching if you&#8217;re looking for music related WordPress Themes and Plugins.</p>\n<p>Brady Vercher was kind enough to answer my <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wordpress-theme-shops-trust/\">WordPress Theme Shops</a> questions.</p>\n<h2>Who is behind AudioTheme and what is the history about AudioTheme?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/\">AudioTheme</a> was originally the brainchild of Luke McDonald. At the time, he was a partner at Press75, which was one of the very first WordPress theme shops. Independently, my twin brother (Brody) and I had published a popular country music blog called The 9513 and while covering independent artists with less-than-stellar websites or no online presence at all, we dreamed up a similar service to help music artists create better websites.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short, I did some unrelated work with Luke when he pitched the idea of partnering up on AudioTheme. We jumped at the opportunity and have been growing ever since.</p>\n<p>Aside from the three of us, most of our customers interact with <a href=\"http://www.annaditommaso.com/\">Anna DiTomasso</a>, who does a superb job handling most of the support on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes do you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AudioTheme_Themes-1024x725.jpg\" alt=\"AudioTheme WordPress Themes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6179\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AudioTheme_Themes-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AudioTheme_Themes-300x212.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AudioTheme_Themes-768x544.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/AudioTheme_Themes.jpg 1525w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>We primarily focus on themes and plugins for bands, musicians and artists. Most of them do have some limited eCommerce integration with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads and we’ll probably focus on improving in that area in the future.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also released a few general-purpose themes under our <a href=\"http://www.cedaro.com/\">Cedaro</a> brand, which is kind of our open source playground for publishing tools and processes that aren&#8217;t related to our work in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/obsidian-1024x557.jpg\" alt=\"Obsidian theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"557\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6180\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/obsidian-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/obsidian-300x163.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/obsidian-768x418.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/obsidian.jpg 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/view/obsidian/\">Obsidian</a> is our most popular theme to date. It’s one of the first ones where we experimented with Flexbox to create a full-screen header on the homepage, which allows people to really highlight their brand in an elegant way. We also added a Customizer control that allows a color overlay on the background image to darken or lighten it up to help improve readability. We’ve seen some really cool sites using Obsidian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/view/marquee/\">Marquee</a> was a bit of an experiment to try something different. When I first saw Brody&#8217;s design, I thought it might be a fun to try to build it out using the REST API, but scrapped that idea in favor PJAX. The partial page loading technique makes the site feel really snappy and allows the menu drawer to stay open, as well as the music to continue playing while visitors browse the site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/view/billboard/\">Billboard</a> isn’t really a theme &#8212; it’s actually a theme in a plugin. We noticed a lot of our customers were using coming soon plugins, took awhile to finish their site, or just didn’t have much content when they were first getting started, so we decided to come up with our own take on a solution. We came up with this micro landing page concept that could be used on its own or as a coming soon/maintenance mode page. It’s designed to be really easy to set up and is completely managed in the Customizer. Its scope is fairly minimal, but has a lot of cool things going on under the hood.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>Code-wise, everything typically starts with a problem &#8212; usually one our customers are experiencing. Then it&#8217;s just a matter of trying to solve it.</p>\n<p>I try to look outside the WordPress bubble at other projects and bring some of those best practices into my WordPress work. There are some incredibly talented people working on WordPress core, so keeping up with what they&#8217;re doing is also inspiring.</p>\n<p>As far as themes go, we mainly follow <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">Underscores</a> to help with the review process on WordPress.com, but do have some common functionality abstracted into a library.</p>\n<p>Brody is an incredible designer who seems to draw from some endless well of creativity. I&#8217;m always in awe of what he&#8217;s able to do.</p>\n<p>Luke is a hybrid designer/developer and seems to dabble in everything, but somehow stays incredibly productive and he’s always got some sort of neat trick up his sleeve.</p>\n<p>I think all of us really just derive inspiration from helping people.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>Our themes are really sold more like bundles. We think of what we&#8217;re doing as providing a holistic solution for musicians with WordPress as the base, so our themes come with many of the plugins that we also sell individually.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have any themes on WordPress.org&#8230; yet. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve considered, but the issues they&#8217;re having with the long queues and anti-commercial stances have generally pushed us to focus on opportunities that will have a greater impact.</p>\n<p>We do work with WordPress.com to release streamlined builds of our themes. They&#8217;ve been good to us, but it’s beginning to get saturated and themes are seeing a shorter shelf life.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been profitable, but this summer has not been kind. It&#8217;s hard to tell if it&#8217;s seasonal or if it&#8217;s part of a longer trend.</p>\n<p>A couple of numbers I find interesting: Over 60% of orders placed the last 90 days have been from countries outside the United States. Given a choice, almost 40% of our customers choose to pay with PayPal instead of a credit card.</p>\n<p>On rare occasions we do take on contract work or partner with other folks, but it doesn&#8217;t make up a significant portion of our revenue.</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>Brody typically mocks up a design in Photoshop and solicits feedback from us. I can&#8217;t be trusted to make design decisions, so Luke cranks out the theme and I&#8217;ll jump in for code review or advanced feature implementation towards the end of the process. Overall, it usually takes a couple of months to finish a theme.</p>\n<p>We spent quite a bit of time honing our tools and have a few custom Grunt tasks to improve code quality and automate some of the tedious tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cedaro/grunt-wp-i18n\">grunt-wp-i18n</a> is one tool we built to internationalize our own themes, but ended up releasing as its own project. It&#8217;s really taken off over the past few years and has been adopted by some of the largest WordPress projects, which is incredibly inspiring &#8212; I just wish it helped pay the bills!</p>\n<h2>Any tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>We have a few tips and tricks on our blogs at <a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/blog/\">AudioTheme</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cedaro.com/blog/\">Cedaro</a>. A lot of musicians are interested in protecting their music, so I recently wrote a <a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/blog/protect-music-uploads/\">post about why that isn’t really feasible</a>. When get enough questions about a topic, we’ll usually write up a blog post or support article.</p>\n<p>One thing I really wish theme developers would do when styling the core audio players is to limit the impact of their styles. The default MediaElement.js styles are pretty difficult to work with, so a lot of theme authors use !important when implement their styles, which stomps all over plugins that provide custom audio players based on MediaElement.js. <a href=\"http://www.cedaro.com/blog/customizing-mediaelement-wordpress/\">I wrote up a blog post on this, too</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>We hope to make it easier for people without prior WordPress experience to get started. That could be getting into hosting ourselves or partnering with existing hosts.</p>\n<p>I have high hopes for improvements to the <a href=\"https://helen.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/theme-disconnect-and-discontent/\">new user experience under Helen Hou-Sandí&#8217;s lead</a> during the WordPress 4.7 release cycle.</p>\n<p>We tempted fate by switching to a subscription model on the Ides of March this year, so we&#8217;re still waiting to see what kind of impact that has when it comes time for renewals.</p>\n<p>In terms of how themes meant for public distribution are built, I don&#8217;t see any major changes, although the REST API would create interesting possibilities for custom site builds and applications. I&#8217;m really hoping the endpoints make it into core relatively soon.</p>\n","<p>I love music. I wish I could play in a band. Heck, I wish I was running AudioTheme!

And my host <a href=\"https://seravo.com/\">WP-palvelu</a> takes care of the rest. Here are more details.</p>\n<h3>Native system fonts</h3>\n<p>Sanse uses native <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/07/native-fonts-in-4-6/\">system fonts just like WordPress admin from version 4.6</a>. This means there is no <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google fonts</a> or any other font stacks to slow theme down. From the core article I like this quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>System fonts load more quickly, have better language support, and make web apps look more like native apps.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I know system fonts might looks kind of silly in a theme but that&#8217;s part of the experiment. And there is child theme with Google fonts coming up.</p>\n<h3>SVG icons instead of font icons</h3>\n<p>I have entirely moved away from icon fonts and use SVG icons instead. In this <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/switch-away-icon-fonts-svg/\">article I have more details</a>. This also means that I don&#8217;t have to load extra CSS file for icon font.</p>\n<p>And I load SVG icons in the footer. Here is interesting <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/issues/169#issuecomment-236269615\">speed comparison for SVG loading</a> from excellent <code>wd_s</code> starter theme.</p>\n<h3>No extra files or images</h3>\n<p>By default there is no header, background, or feature images. This was also design decision but in the same time it means faster loading times.</p>\n<p>For assets theme only loads <code>style.css</code> and <code>navigation.js</code> files. Actually those are also minified (<code>style.min.css</code> and <code>navigation.min.js</code>).</p>\n<p>Note that you need to use <code>stylesheet_uri</code> filter to get <code>style.min.css</code> correctly in public theme. You can see it in action (code by Justin Tadlock) in <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/sanse/blob/master/functions.php\">functions.php file</a>.</p>\n<h3>No extra plugins</h3>\n<p>In my demo site I don&#8217;t use any extra plugins. They could have new CSS or Javascript files on the front end which slows the site a little bit. So be careful when activating new plugins if speed is your priority.</p>\n<h3>Good host</h3>\n<p>Good host is important part of your site speed. On shared hosting your site could load slower. As I mentioned my demo is on <a href=\"https://seravo.com/features/\">Seravo hosting</a>. I can highly recommend them. I have heard good things about <a href=\"https://pagely.com/\">Pagely</a> also. But let&#8217;s leave host comparison for another post.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/some/\">Some theme</a> Sanse support one menu, <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/svg-social-menu-in-wordpress/\">SVG social menu</a>, and three widget areas in the footer.

It&#8217;s still the place where I get help and can follow the latest things in WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Who is behind Theme Hybrid and what is the history about Theme Hybrid?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s just me, Justin Tadlock.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Theme Hybrid</a> started as a response to the &#8220;premium&#8221; theme movement back in 2008.  At that time, these premium themes were usually under proprietary, non-GPL licensing and completely locked users away from the freedoms that they would normally receive.  Users were paying money for fewer freedoms.  While I didn&#8217;t completely understand open source at the time, I felt like the direction that these theme shops were going was not in the best interest of users.</p>\n<p>I was barely out of college and had no clue what I was doing in terms of business (still don&#8217;t). There was huge support for the project, so I just rolled with it.  No business plan.  Donors paid for the entire first year of hosting.  Ian Stewart came up with the design for the logo.</p>\n<p>I officially launched the site right before I moved home from overseas. I had $1600 cash, no job prospects, and was sleeping on my sister&#8217;s couch.  The first month brought in around $900.</p>\n<p>Theme Hybrid was off the ground and running.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build (general, certain niche, business, eCommerce etc.)?

The more general-purpose, the more users it tends to attract.</p>\n<p>However, I plan to move toward specific niches with upcoming themes. A lot of the ideas I&#8217;ve had in the past simply were not easily doable with older versions of WP.  Now that WP has a lot more useful theme-related features, I have some ideas I want to try out.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p>I usually hate my themes by the time I&#8217;m done with them. It&#8217;s exciting in the beginning, but after month&#8217;s of work, I get tired of looking at the same thing. 😉</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/stargazer/\">Stargazer</a> is one of the finer pieces of work I&#8217;ve done.  The design is aging a bit at this point to me (that&#8217;s what child themes are for anyway), but so much of what&#8217;s under the hood is really cool from a development standpoint. A lot of the ideas I had when building it went into the <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\">Hybrid Core framework</a>. Some of those ideas I&#8217;m still fleshing out today.</p>\n<p>The following is a screenshot of a theme I&#8217;m currently working on. I haven&#8217;t gotten tired of it yet. It&#8217;ll be a theme for artists, photographers, and other creative folks.  It&#8217;ll be compatible with both the <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio\">Custom Content Portfolio</a> and <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> plugins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/happy-016.png\" target=\"_blank\">See here new theme screenshot</a> (opens in new window).</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>Everywhere.  Nowhere.</p>\n<p>What I mean is that inspiration is all around us.  A good artist in any field is going to draw inspiration from everything, even without realizing it. I can&#8217;t point out any one particular thing or group of things that inspire me.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>*Strategy?* Hope with a healthy dose of fear.</p>\n<p>Really, right now, Theme Hybrid sells support memberships. This gives users access to the support forums and a live chat system (via Slack) to get help with themes and plugins. I have plans to move into selling more products (and have already done so with a couple of plugins).  How that plays out with the themes side of the business is yet to be determined.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like giving numbers. Numbers don&#8217;t always tell the same truth to different people.</p>\n<p>Business are going to have good years and bad years. And, you always want to do better. It&#8217;s no different for me. As long as you enjoy the work on most days and can put food on the table, it&#8217;s a win in my book.</p>\n<p>My other business is <a href=\"http://themereview.co\">ThemeReview.co</a>. My partner, Sakin Shrestha, and I do theme/plugin code, security, and design reviews.</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>I mostly build everything in-browser with no workflow. I just work on the pieces that interest me in the moment.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like a lot of tools, so I keep it simple.  For programming, I use Notepad++. For some design items, Photoshop. For version control, GitHub.  These are my day-to-day tools.  There are, of course, other minor tools that I use at times.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>Plugins are the future. That&#8217;s probably not something I should say in a &#8220;theme development&#8221; interview. 🙂</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;ll still be doing themes, plugins are now my #1 focus. This has been a major shift in the past year or so. But, plugin users are the majority of people signing up to my site, primarily for <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/plugins/members\">Members plugin</a> support.</p>\n<p>Even if they were not outpacing my theme users in sales, I still think plugin development is where WP businesses should be focused. The theme marketplace is saturated and rarely has a fresh and innovative idea.  The really cool stuff is what plugin authors are doing these days.</p>\n<p>I see themes changing to be &#8220;support members&#8221; for plugins. Users want themes that handle Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce, bbPress, BuddyPress, and other plugins.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to break stuff.</p>\n","<p>Many WordPress Theme Shops say that they offer great support. But it&#8217;s nothing compares to Theme Hybrid support by Justin Tadlock. It&#8217;s the best place to get themes, plugins, support, ideas, and learn.

But seriously, <a href=\"https://prothemedesign.com/\">Pro Theme Design</a> have an eye for great design and the code is Pro. What more can you ask. I&#8217;m honoured to have them as part of my <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wordpress-theme-shops-trust/\">interview series about WordPress Theme Shops</a>.</p>\n<p>I can relate to so many things (simplicity, accessibility) that came up in this interview. Let&#8217;s get the ball rolling, shall we.</p>\n<h2>Who is behind Pro Theme Design and what is the history about Pro Theme Design?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://prothemedesign.com/\">Pro Theme Design</a> was founded in 2007 when I contacted Darren Hoyt about creating a premium theme together. We&#8217;d both had a small amount of success making free themes and I thought we might be able to do something that could make us some pocket money. These days Pro Theme Design is entirely run by me, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gillbanks</a>. I still partner with Darren, and sometimes other designers, but in general the site is entirely run by myself.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build (general, certain niche, business, eCommerce etc.)? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pro_Theme_Design_Themes-1024x948.jpg\" alt=\"Pro Theme Design Themes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"948\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6154\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pro_Theme_Design_Themes-1024x948.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pro_Theme_Design_Themes-300x278.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pro_Theme_Design_Themes-768x711.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pro_Theme_Design_Themes.jpg 1167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>I create general themes that are targeted at specific niches. The themes are designed to have clean code, and simple designs, and be easy to personalize. My target audience is WordPress implementers. People who want to buy simple themes that can be easily customized for their clients.</p>\n<p>My focus is on simplicity. I want the themes to be simple both visually, and in terms of code &#038; options. Most of my themes have less than 5 options in the Customizer, some don&#8217;t have any. That said &#8211; because I support all of the WordPress default functionality &#8211; and most of Jetpacks features &#8211; my themes are still very flexible. I am constantly amazed by the things I see people doing with them. You can see a small sample on the <a href=\"https://prothemedesign.com/theme-showcase/\">Pro Theme Design showcase</a>.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<p>In general I am most proud of the themes I have made most recently. I seem to learn something new with each theme I make, and my two most recently released themes are definitely my best so far.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Passenger-1024x581.jpg\" alt=\"Passenger screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"581\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6156\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Passenger-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Passenger-300x170.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Passenger-768x436.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Passenger.jpg 1904w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prothemedesign.com/theme/passenger/\">Passenger</a> is a theme designed for scrapbookers and travel bloggers. It has quite a unique design, that&#8217;s meant to emulate physical media. It&#8217;s also the first theme I have made that has had a full accessibility review.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/theme/carmack\">Carmack</a> is my most recent theme, and I would say my most technically advanced. I learnt loads with this theme. I switched from less to sass and I used svgs instead of icon fonts. I also got this theme accessibility reviewed &#8211; all my themes will be accessible from now on. I&#8217;m currently preparing Carmack for self hosted sites but you can <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/theme/carmack\">see it on WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>For design I like to use <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribbble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.designernews.co/\">DesignerNews</a>. I&#8217;m currently really interested in finding designs that are different. Websites are looking more and more alike and I&#8217;d like to make something that works in a different way.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really have a place for inspiration for code. Sometimes I&#8217;ll see people mention something interesting on Twitter and I&#8217;ll store it for future use. Other times I see a nice effect or trick on a website I&#8217;m visiting so I&#8217;ll inspect element and work out how it was done.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried all sorts of things. Currently most of my sales are through <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=pro-theme-design\">WordPress.com</a> but I want to shift this so I am less reliant on them. I currently have one theme on WordPress.org, and two more that have been submitted. I plan to make some more in the future and try upselling premium versions of them. I&#8217;m also working with Alex Denning on a WordPress course that we hope to release in September 2016.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>Pro Theme Design earns enough money for me (and my family) to live on &#8211; and I work on it full time. There&#8217;s no other businesses.</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>Currently I use <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> for code editing, <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/\">Sketch</a> for design, a combination of Codekit and Gulp for building things. My local dev environment is powered by MAMP and a host of WordPress plugins, many custom made, that help me to build things quickly.</p>\n<p>I have a starter theme I use that I made. It&#8217;s a combination of a theme called Gravy that Darren made years ago, <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">_s</a>, and various changes I have made over the last few years of using it. With the starter theme and my custom plugins, I can build new themes quite quickly. The slow part is coming up with a unique design, and then testing it in all the possible combinations.</p>\n<p>Like my themes, I like to simplify my process as much as possible. Anything I can automate I will. If it means I get to spend less time on the mundane/ repetitive things and more on doing the things I enjoy then it has to be a good thing.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>As I said earlier, I&#8217;d like to reduce my reliance on WordpPess.com &#8211; so one of my focuses is going to be on increasing sales through <a href=\"https://prothemedesign.com/\">Pro Theme Design</a>. I am also looking at building related products &#8211; such as WordPress courses. I don&#8217;t see themes themselves changing a great deal. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the WordPress REST API but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much need for it in the themeing world &#8211; at least not in the short term.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t use <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores starter theme</a>, it&#8217;s worth downloading and dismantling. There&#8217;s a lot of cool tricks in there that probably aren&#8217;t immediately obvious. Follow the WordPress coding standards (PHPCS is your friend).</p>\n<p>Finally, just build stuff. It&#8217;s the best way to learn.</p>\n","<p>How clever title is that. But seriously, Pro Theme Design have an eye for great design and the code is Pro. What more can you ask.

We develop premium niche WordPress themes and lately we focus on non-profit and blog niches.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6141\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bubi.jpg\" alt=\"Bubi Teddy bear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6141\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bubi.jpg 1000w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bubi-300x227.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bubi-768x581.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bubi is so cute.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>How it all began?</h3>\n<p>We started in 2012, but it got more serious somewhere during 2013. I started learning theme development in 2012 so it took a while to get a grip on how this whole thing work. At that time Marko was still a full time musician.</p>\n<p>I guess this still doesn&#8217;t answer the question how we ended up developing themes. Well, after I finished Civil Engineering studies I was sure this is not something I&#8217;d want to do for the rest of my life :). I always wanted to do something creative and with Marko’s support I started learning HTML, CSS and soon after turned to WordPress.</p>\n<p>About the same time Marko started to feel a bit of a burnout as a musician. He simply didn’t have fun doing gigs and teaching guitar anymore, so he decided to pause that and join our new adventure.</p>\n<p>Business with themes got bigger and more time consuming so we decided to focus on it together and make it our main project. As one of our main goals was to build a business that is independent of the place of living.</p>\n<p>First we started selling themes on <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/\">Themeforest</a>. However, for various reasons soon decided to open our own theme shop Anariel Design and join other marketplaces instead of being exclusive on Themeforest.</p>\n<p>In 2014 we were invited to sell <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=anariel-design\">our themes on WordPress.com</a> for which we are really thankful and proud. Being able to sell our themes there is a dream come true and at that time it was also a verification that we&#8217;re doing something right. There are so many things on theme development that I learned going through their theme review process. That all improved the quality of our themes a lot. Big thanks to <a href=\"https://philiparthurmoore.com/\">Philip Arthur Moore</a> for the invite (editors note: he actually invited me also).</p>\n<p>We also started to submit “lite” versions of our themes to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/anariel-design/\">WordPress.org repository</a> as I way to give something back to the community that enabled us to do what we do now.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build (general, certain niche, business, eCommerce etc.)? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anariel_design_themes-1024x704.jpg\" alt=\"Anariel Design Themes\" width=\"1024\" height=\"704\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6148\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anariel_design_themes-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anariel_design_themes-300x206.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anariel_design_themes-768x528.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anariel_design_themes.jpg 1510w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>We are creating niche themes and lately we focus on themes for bloggers and non-profit organizations. Every single theme we do is built with certain niche in mind &#038; every feature included in it is carefully chosen to support theme&#8217;s purpose.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say our target audience are people who are looking for unique niche focused, easy to use high-quality themes.</p>\n<p>Through some of our theme demos we try to support real non-profit organizations by creating real demo content related to the purpose of the organization. That way we hope to spread the word about the certain problem and if someone gets touched by it and decides to act upon it, that is great.</p>\n<p>Good example of that is our latest theme Pena . The demo is about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3gF3DPTCfA\">Living on One Dollar documentary</a> and their mission.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of.

They are all easy to use, use basic, core WordPress features (pages,post,categories, widgets) to create site that is easy to use even for very beginners. All our themes are about matching unique and fresh ideas with simplicity and user-friendliness. We believe that most people need simple yet effective solutions for their online presence. This very philosophy is built into everything we do.</p>\n<p>Pena I mentioned above is a very special project, more than just a theme. It has been inspired by “Living on One Dollar” documentary we watched one night. We were deeply touched and wanted to somehow contribute to the whole project. We decided to develop a WordPress theme to help spread the word about it. We connected with the guys behind the documentary and they allowed us to use the content for the demo.</p>\n<p>This is a really special project for us and we built theme demo using real content that we hope will raise the awareness about the problems in Peña Blanca and spread the word about this great documentary.</p>\n<p>Maisha has also a special place in our hearts. It’s been inspired by an amazing documentary named “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT04RG15azM&#038;feature=youtu.be\">Virunga</a>” that can really make you cry. If you haven’t seen that documentary yet, please<br />\ndo ;).</p>\n<p>Didi is a modern theme for fashion bloggers. There are no jumping or moving columns or any unneeded flashy effects that only compete for readers attention. Just a well thought out, logical and SEO friendly layout that make reading experience a joy.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned above our big inspiration for non-profit themes are documentaries that cover certain social, environmental and similar issues.</p>\n<p>For our new theme, which is coming soon, I&#8217;ve been inspired by my school friend Lola who loves fashion. It is a blogging theme and it is dedicated to her.</p>\n<p>I like visiting <a href=\"http://www.awwwards.com/\">Awwwards</a> site as there you can find the latest trends and draw inspiration out of it. I also follow CodePen, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/\">ThemeShaper</a>,  <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/\">WPTavern</a>, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a>, <a href=\"https://managewp.org/\">ManageWP.org</a>, Twitter, <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\">Flipboard</a> to get the news and learn more.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>Please beware that we are pretty bad at marketing so if you meant to learn something from us, I&#8217;m sorry ;). We really didn&#8217;t do much in that respect so far.</p>\n<p>Yes, we sell our themes on WordPress.com and also have lite versions of our themes on WordPress.org, but that&#8217;s mostly it. However, we put much time and effort supporting our<br />\nthemes. We also try to give it a human and friendly touch cause we believe that, beside the theme quality, support is the most important part in this business.</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>We are pretty much satisfied how the theme business is going for us and at the moment this is our only source of income. I’d rather not go into numbers but what I can say is that WordPress.com is our main market closely followed by our theme shop and then ThemeForest &#038; few smaller marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Considering the lack of active marketing we are quite happy to have our site bring around the third of the total revenue. Our main goal for the future is to make our theme shop our main source of income. </p>\n<h2>Any specific work flow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>First I look for something to inspire me. That can be a documentary, a person, some other design and so on.Then I do a research on what&#8217;s necessary for the certain niche. For example if it is a non-profit theme then I look for real non-profit websites and make notes on what are important elements and features of the non-profit website. Then I decide the color scheme and do a sketch of the front page in Photoshop.</p>\n<p>To code the theme I use Underscores based starter theme. I use just a Dreamweaver (old school ;)) for writing code. During development I use Theme Check Plugin, RTL tester etc. Once the theme is done we do a lot of checks to see if something is missing or not working properly. In the end I create theme demo and the documentation.</p>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>Our future plans are to further improve our themes and to work on promoting our own theme shop.</p>\n<p>We also plan to attend WordCamps whenever we can and meet new people. There are so many incredible people with so many interesting life stories. Sami is one of them 🙂</p>\n<p>I think the biggest challenge for themes in the future is to make them more user-friendly and easier to use for the non-technical end user. I think that merging themes and hosting in a single easy to use package (like <a href=\"https://www.themecloud.io/\">Themecloud</a> does) is something we&#8217;ll see more often in the future.</p>\n<p>Accessibility is another important issue. Making themes more accessible for the people with disabilities is definitely one of the important challenges.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>One tip for people searching for a new theme for their site. Before you even go looking for a theme write down a few notes on what your site needs and what kind of layout you&#8217;d like to have on your site. Once you know that, look for a theme that comes as close as possible to your vision. It is much easier and takes less time to search for the right theme than to simply buy the first multi-purpose theme and then trying to adapt it to your own purpose.</p>\n<p>For developers I&#8217;d say it is important is to be aware of your strengths and shortcomings and concentrate on what you do best. Find your own niche, something you love to create and where you can give your 100%. What is most important, do the best work you can at any given moment, create the best theme you can and give the best support.</p>\n","<p>I&#8217;m more than happy to publish my next WordPress Theme Shop interview.

As a math teacher I really like their slogan. And that&#8217;s not only slogan. It&#8217;s the fact:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Making WordPress themes with mathematical precision to detail</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been following man behind Themetry (Leland Fiegel) for a while and we are totally on the same page. Pretty much everything he says about WordPress themes (or other things), I&#8217;m like, yes, yes, and YES! He has friendly and professional touch.</p>\n<p>I can recommend Themetry from the bottom of my heart. Designs are fresh, code is top notch, and Leland knows what he&#8217;s doing. Let him tell more about his WordPress Theme Shop. </p>\n<h2>Who is behind Themetry and what is the history about Themetry?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://themetry.com/\">Themetry</a> has only a single employee, me (Leland Fiegel). I handle all the theme development and support, occasionally write on the blog, and represent the business at events like WordCamps and in interviews like this one. 🙂</p>\n<p>While I am the only employee, I frequently collaborate with designer Tung Do, who some old-school WordPressers may remember from his popular website, WP Designer. Although he sold the site and it has since gone defunct, his WordPress design skills are better than ever.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6127\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6127\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6127\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Owari-1024x692.jpg\" alt=\"Owari theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"692\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Owari-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Owari-300x203.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Owari-768x519.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Owari.jpg 1598w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6127\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://themetry.com/themes/owari/\">Owari</a> theme designed by Tung Do.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Themetry&#8217;s history is a short one, starting in late 2015. This was long after countless theme shops have come and gone, and long after many considered the &#8220;theme gold rush&#8221; to be over.</p>\n<p>Although Themetry is a new company, I am not new to themes. I had my own popular theme website called Theme Lab, which I started back in 2007. It was acquired in 2013, but I found myself not able to shake my passion for theming.</p>\n<p>I noticed many of the original theme companies were not really theme companies anymore, largely shifting their business to premium plugins, page builders, and SaaS services. I felt this trend left room for someone like me who wanted to create &#8220;just&#8221; a theme company, so I did.</p>\n<p>After launching a couple successful themes, I decided to leave my job as a WordPress developer at a local agency in January 2016, and have been working on Themetry full-time ever since.</p>\n<p>I also run a WordPress community forum, <a href=\"https://wpchat.com/\">WP Chat</a>, and help organize the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/\">WordPress DC</a> meetup.</p>\n<h2>What kind of themes you build? Is there a target audience for your themes?</h2>\n<p>The target audience of Themetry are people looking for themes that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have high-quality code.</li>\n<li>Exhibit superb design.</li>\n<li>Are designed with purpose.</li>\n<li>Adhere to WordPress best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each theme we have is designed with a specific purpose in mind. For example, we have a theme designed for fashion magazines, and another designed for food bloggers.</p>\n<p>Of course, customers are welcome to take our themes in different directions, but we would never intentionally design a &#8220;multi purpose&#8221; or &#8220;general&#8221; theme.</p>\n<h2>Showcase 2-3 of your themes that you are most proud of. Why they are cool themes?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6121\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6121\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6121 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adaline-1024x791.jpg\" alt=\"Adaline theme screenshot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adaline-1024x791.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adaline-300x232.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adaline-768x593.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adaline.jpg 1399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6121\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://themetry.com/themes/adaline/\">Adaline</a> WordPress Theme</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://themetry.com/themes/adaline/\">Adaline</a> and <a href=\"https://themetry.com/themes/owari/\">Owari</a> are probably my two favorites. They manage to bring a professional look without the complication of configuring theme options, page builders, etc.</p>\n<p>I like when customers are pleasantly surprised that all they have to do to set up the theme is just use WordPress in a natural way. Simply publish posts, fill in a widget area or two, and the theme shapes the rest.</p>\n<h2>Where do you get inspiration for design and code?</h2>\n<p>I can&#8217;t speak much about design inspiration since I don&#8217;t do any of the design for Themetry themes. Like many other people in the web design industry, I am a fan of <a href=\"http://www.awwwards.com/\">Awwwards</a>.</p>\n<p>For code, there&#8217;s no better place than <a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>. And I&#8217;ll usually find myself on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\">CSS Tricks</a> if I need to get up to speed on a new CSS technique.</p>\n<h2>What is your business and marketing strategy? (Do you have themes on wp.org, wp.com, lite versions, commercial versions, memberships etc.)</h2>\n<p>All of the above. Also, we have experimented with converting one of our popular themes to a Genesis theme, which we are currently selling on the StudioPress store.</p>\n<p>I like to experiment with different business models just to see what works best, then hone in on that. So far, the lion&#8217;s share of my revenue comes through WordPress.com sales, but my long-term goal is to sustain Themetry mostly off of theme club memberships.</p>\n<p>Right now, a theme club doesn&#8217;t make too much sense because our theme collection is quite small, but we&#8217;re working on that.</p>\n<p>I still need to maintain a careful balance between quality and quantity. 🙂</p>\n<h2>How is your theme business doing and do you have other business? Any numbers to give?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather not go into specifics, but let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s going about as well as you could expect for such a new theme company.</p>\n<p>Thankfully we were able to quickly ship a few themes that generate enough revenue to stay profitable, and we use that profit in order to pay more designers for more themes that align with our theme philosophy. I&#8217;m excited about the growth potential. 🙂</p>\n<h2>Any specific workflow how you build themes? What kind of development tools you use?</h2>\n<p>First, I like to take an inventory of all the designs, make notes of what components are used in multiple places, and envision how I&#8217;ll code it before writing a single line.</p>\n<p>Then, I&#8217;ll generate an <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a>-based starter theme, set up a local installation with Ampps, load some demo content, and start working. I&#8217;ll set up an identical site on my live demo site and periodically sync code through <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">BitBucket</a> so I can show people I&#8217;m working with progress.</p>\n<p>I mainly just use a vanilla version of <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">SublimeText</a> to write my code on my macOS devices. And phpcs to clean up any WordPress Coding Standards issues.</p>\n<p>And of course, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check Plugin</a>. A must-have tool for any WordPress themer (Editors note: Read about <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/do-it-yourself-theme-review/\">do it yourself theme review</a>).</p>\n<h2>Any other tips and tricks you want to share for users and for other theme developers?</h2>\n<p>Lots of them! I&#8217;d direct people to the <a href=\"https://themetry.com/blog/\">Themetry Blog</a> to stay up to date, but just to name a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://themetry.com/never-inline-css/\">Avoid inline CSS</a> at all costs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themetry.com/beginner-empathy/\">Remember what it&#8217;s like to be a beginner</a>, so don&#8217;t insult your theme users if they don&#8217;t understand something seemingly basic.</li>\n<li>Make your themes translation friendly, and provide <a href=\"https://themetry.com/rtl-stylesheets/\">RTL stylesheets</a>. Not everybody wants to publish in left-to-right, or just in English.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themetry.com/hover-revealed-content/\">Don&#8217;t hide content behind hovers</a>, and otherwise never compromise UX in favor of some trendy effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are your future plans? Do you see themes changing in some direction?</h2>\n<p>My future plans are to stay the course. Steadily build a collection of high-quality, purpose-built themes with best practices in mind.</p>\n<p>People are getting sick of terrible theme user experiences. Every time somebody&#8217;s site gets hacked because of a bundled plugin that wasn&#8217;t kept up to date, every time somebody loses large chunks of content because it&#8217;s trapped in a proprietary page builder after a theme change, every time a site breaks due to a <a href=\"https://themetry.com/theme-update-panic/\">mismanaged theme update</a>&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;I could go on, but every time something like that happens, it&#8217;s just going to push more people to theme shops like ours.</p>\n","<p>I created WordPress Theme Shops list and I&#8217;m happy to start interviews with Themetry.

Starting with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/grahamarmfield\">Graham Armfield</a> who gave excellent <strong>Assistive Technology Demo</strong> talk. He showed how <a href=\"http://www.nuance.com/dragon/index.htm\">Dragon</a> (voice recognition software) and <a href=\"http://www.nvaccess.org/\">NVDA</a> (a screen reader) is used and how they work.</p>\n<p>Rian Rietveld talked about <a href=\"http://www.rianrietveld.com/2016/06/wceu16/\">state of the accessibility</a>. There are lot&#8217;s of things to be done but accessibility is getting better and better. Core team has also made clear decision about accessibility:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All new or updated code released into WordPress core and bundled themes must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was also very glad that Rian outlined that we should learn accessibility deeply, not just trendy Javascript.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Clear message: learn accessibility deeply too!

How would I get just the Javascript and CSS what I need for accordion?</p>\n<p>Well you can do exactly that using <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/#customizeFoundation\">custom download</a>. Uncheck everything else and check only accordion.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Foundation_accordion-e1466157761319.png\" alt=\"Select accordion\" width=\"571\" height=\"227\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5926\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Foundation_accordion-e1466157761319.png 571w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Foundation_accordion-e1466157761319-300x119.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" /></p>\n<p>From the download folder we&#8217;re going to need three files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Javascript file <strong>app.js</strong>.</li>\n<li>Javascript file <strong>vendor/foundation.js</strong>.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>css/foundation.css</strong> file we&#8217;re going to need some of the code. Search for keyword <strong>accordion</strong> and select only related styles. Here are my <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/test-accordion/blob/master/css/styles.css\">styles</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that it&#8217;s up to you how you&#8217;re going to use those components in you plugin or theme.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility in Foundation Accordion</h2>\n<p>The main reason why I wanted to test Foundation accordion was accessibility. And I&#8217;ll have to say I&#8217;m pretty impressed. There are lot&#8217;s of accessibility improvements since I last checked.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard Accessibility</h3>\n<p>In Foundation accordion keyboard accessibility is top notch.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can use Tab and Enter (Space) to navigate trough accordion.</li>\n<li>Focus don&#8217;t shift inside accordion before I open the accordion item.</li>\n<li>I can also use arrow keys up and down to navigate trough accordion. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only thing that confuses me is the accordion title and it&#8217;s markup. Accordion title is the element that toggles the accordion content.</p>\n<pre>&lt;a class=\"accordion-title\" href=\"#\"&gt;Accordion 1&lt;/a&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>I can&#8217;t change the accordion title markup to <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> which is kind of odd. But on the other hand there are ARIA markup to help screen reader users.</p>\n<h3>Screen Readers Accessibility</h3>\n<p>I have only <a href=\"http://www.nvaccess.org/\">NVDA screen reader</a> for testing. And I&#8217;m not a native screen reader user so I probably don&#8217;t even know how to test correctly. Anyways NVDA announced accordion items really well. Like I said before there are ARIA markup that helps screen reader users.</p>\n<p>Only thing that bothered me was that also the plus-sign was announced with the accordion title. That comes from the CSS.</p>\n<pre>\r\n.accordion-title::before {\r\n\tcontent: '+';\r\n\tposition: absolute;\r\n\tright: 1rem;\r\n\ttop: 50%;\r\n\tmargin-top: -0.5rem;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>But this is minor thing and we could even use <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/simple-accessible-svg-menu-hamburger-animation/\">animated SVGs</a> instead.</p>\n<h3>Does it work without Javascript?</h3>\n<p>By default it does not. Accordion tabs stays closed if Javascript is not enabled. In my opinion all the accordion tabs should be open when Javascript is disabled or doesn&#8217;t load.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5929\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5929\" style=\"width: 853px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Accordion_without_Javascript.png\" alt=\"Accordion tabs opened\" width=\"853\" height=\"686\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5929\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Accordion_without_Javascript.png 853w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Accordion_without_Javascript-300x241.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Accordion_without_Javascript-768x618.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5929\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All accordion tabs are open when Javascript is disabled</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I added one line of CSS for make this work:</p>\n<pre>\r\n.js .accordion-content {\r\n\tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now accordion content is hidden only when JS is around. Here is the article <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/detecting-javascript-in-wordpress/\">how to detect Javascript</a> and adding <code>no-js / js</code> class in <code>HTML</code> element.</p>\n<h2>Demo and test code</h2>\n<p>Here you go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/test-accordion\">Test plugin in Github</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/test-accordion/\">Demo site</a> with only this plugin enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>I was sceptical before testing but I was actually positively surprised.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has enough settings to display accordion in a way you want.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s easy to set up and isolate from the foundation code.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s accessible as far as I can tell.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Foundation accordion does depend on <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> but that&#8217;s a minor issue if we&#8217;re using jQuery already in our project. But I can definitely recommend Foundation accordion if you need one. To make testing more useful I should test others accessible accordions. But that&#8217;s for another day.

We build these fancy <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/accessible-full-screen-menu/\">full screen menus</a> or <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/testing-foundation-accordion/\">accordions</a> but do they work if Javascript is disabled or it doesn&#8217;t load. In my opinion they should work.</p>\n<p>In most cases I have used method seen in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/\">Twenty Sixteen</a> WordPress theme. It has three steps.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Add no-js class to html element</h2>\n<p>Add <code>no-js</code> class to <code>html</code> element which is usually in <code>header.php</code> file.</p>\n<pre>&lt;html &lt;?php language_attributes(); ?&gt; class=\"no-js\"&gt;</pre>\n<p>Step one done. In the next step we change <code>no-js</code> class to <code>js</code> class if Javascript is detected.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Add Javascript detection</h2>\n<p>In your themes <code>functions.php</code> file (or custom plugin) add this code:</p>\n<pre>/**\r\n * Handles JavaScript detection.\r\n *\r\n * Adds a `js` class to the root `&lt;html&gt;` element when JavaScript is detected.\r\n *\r\n * @since Twenty Sixteen 1.0\r\n */\r\nfunction twentysixteen_javascript_detection() {\r\n\techo \"&lt;script&gt;(function(html){html.className = html.className.replace(/\\bno-js\\b/,'js')})(document.documentElement);&lt;/script&gt;\\n\";\r\n}\r\nadd_action( 'wp_head', 'twentysixteen_javascript_detection', 0 );\r\n</pre>\n<p>It adds Javascript in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and change <code>no-js</code> class to <code>js</code> class if Javascript is detected.</p>\n<p>Step two done.</p>\n<h3>Styles using no-js or js classes</h3>\n<p>Rest is totally up to you. Now you can use classes <code>no-js</code> and <code>js</code> classes however you want and for example <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/testing-foundation-accordion/\">Foundation accordion</a> works nicely even without Javascript.</p>\n","<p>Does you full screen menu or other fancy Javascript based solution work without Javascript?

I personally use service called <a href=\"https://icomoon.io/app/#/select\">Icomoon App</a> where you can import any font icon or SVG image. App auto-generates SVG icons and SVG sprite for you. You can also use Grunt or Gulp tools, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/tree/master/assets/images/svg-icons\">wd_s starter theme</a> have great example of using Gulp.</p>\n<p>Also read Sara Soueidan article about <a href=\"https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/icon-fonts-to-svg/\">switching away from icon font to SVG</a>.

Leland Fiegel picked up my question in Twitter and rolled <a href=\"https://themetry.com/svg-social-menu-wordpress/\">his own idea</a>. It&#8217;s not bad solution but what if we could do this without Javascript.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to explain how and why I&#8217;m using social menu with SVG icons. <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/some/\">Some WordPress theme</a> works as an <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/some/\">demo example</a> and it can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/some\">Github</a> also.</p>\n<h2>Why SVG instead of icon fonts</h2>\n<p>There is nothing wrong using icon fonts. Just make sure you are <a href=\"https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/accessibility/\">using icon fonts in a accessible way</a>. But there are several reasons why SVG images are a little better than icon fonts. CSS Tricks article <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/\">Inline SVG vs Font Icons</a> explains the differences really well. Comparison included these bullet points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SVG icons are vectors not text which can lead blurry looking font icons.</li>\n<li>CSS control is even better because you can control different parts of multi-part icon. Or even <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/simple-accessible-svg-menu-hamburger-animation/\">animate</a> them.</li>\n<li>Positioning can sometimes be really annoying when using icon fonts (line height, pseudo after or before rules). That&#8217;s not going to be problem when using SVG images.</li>\n<li>Font loading can have issues.</li>\n<li>@font-face is not supported in every browser. Well, not all old browser support SVG either.</li>\n<li>SVG images seems more semantic way of adding icons than icon font.</li>\n<li>In both methods accessibility can be a problem, just remember to take care of it.</li>\n<li>SVG sprite system is fast and icons are easy to create in <a href=\"https://icomoon.io/app/#/select\">Icomoon App</a>.</li>\n<li>Icon fonts have deeper browser support you can roll fallback for SVG if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also other articles about SVG vs icon fonts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.cloudfour.com/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/\">Seriously, Don’t Use Icon Fonts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.cloudfour.com/our-svg-icon-process/\">Our SVG Icon Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/blog/2112-delivering-octicons-with-svg\">Github using Octicons with SVG</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html\">Bulletproof Accessible Icon Fonts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like the summarize on Github article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By switching from icon fonts, we can serve our icons more easily, more quickly, and more accessibly. And they look better. Enjoy.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Where to get SVG icons</h2>\n<p>I have only used service called <a href=\"https://icomoon.io/app/#/select\">Icomoon App</a>. It has it&#8217;s own icons but you can also <strong>import any icons</strong> you want in there. I usually import icons from <a href=\"https://genericons.com/\">Genericons</a> or <a href=\"https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\">Fontawesome</a>. Great thing about Icomoon App is that you can pick the icons you want, generate SVG code one be one, or download example .zip file which includes <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/some/blob/master/assets/images/svg-icons.svg\">SVG sprite file</a>. It&#8217;s called <strong>symbol-defs.svg</strong>. At the moment I manually clean up the file a little bit by removing all titles and fills.</p>\n<p>You can also use Gulp tools to generate SVG sprite for you. <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/tree/master/assets/images/svg-icons\">wd_s starter theme</a> has a perfect example.</p>\n<p>In custom projects I also import all icons from designer and let Icomoon App generate the SVG code for me.</p>\n<h2>Using SVG sprites</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways to use <a href=\"https://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/\">SVG sprite system</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inline SVG sprite.</li>\n<li>External SVG sprite.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I both ways we can use <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/blob/master/inc/template-tags.php#L124\">helpful function</a> for generating SVG markup. By the way read everything what <a href=\"https://sarasoueidan.com/tags/svg/index.html\">Sara Soueidan</a> writes about SVG images.</p>\n<h3>1. Inline SVG sprite</h3>\n<p>The code below demonstrates how to use inline SVG sprite:</p>\n<pre>&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;?php\r\n// 1. Include SVG images from assets/images folder right after &lt;body&gt; element.\r\n$svg_icons = get_template_directory() . '/assets/images/svg-icons.svg';\r\nrequire_once( $svg_icons );\r\n\r\n\r\n// 2. Include for example Twitter icon from SVG sprite. This can be anywhere in your markup.\r\n?&gt;\r\n&lt;svg class=\"icon icon-twitter\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;use xlink:href=\"#twitter-icon\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\r\n&lt;svg&gt;\r\n\t\r\n&lt;?php\r\n// 3. Or even better use function _s_get_svg() found in wd_s to generetate the markup.\r\n// @link: https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/blob/master/inc/template-tags.php#L124\r\n\r\necho _s_get_svg( array( 'icon' =&gt; 'twitter' ) );</pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Include the SVG sprite right after body element.</li>\n<li>Use SVG markup anywhere you want.</li>\n<li>Or even better use <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/blob/master/inc/template-tags.php#L124\">_s_get_svg()</a> function to output markup for you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The problem with inline SVG can be caching. If you have lot&#8217;s of icons and they are included in every page after body element, page might render a little bit slower.</p>\n<p>If you have only couple of icons in your SVG sprite, I&#8217;d still use inline sprite method. Caching can be solved using external  SVG sprite.</p>\n<h3>2. External SVG sprite</h3>\n<p>Using external SVG image is pretty much the same but you don&#8217;t need to include SVG icons after body element. And in <code>&lt;use&gt;</code>-element you reference the external SVG file.</p>\n<pre>&lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n// 2. Include for example Twitter icon from SVG sprite. This can be anywhere in your markup.\r\n?&gt;\r\n&lt;svg class=\"icon icon-twitter\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;use xlink:href=\"path/to/icons.svg#twitter-icon\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\r\n&lt;svg&gt;\r\n\t\r\n&lt;?php\r\n// 3. Or even better use function some_get_svg() found in \"Some\" to generetate the markup.\r\n// @link: https://github.com/samikeijonen/some/blob/master/inc/template-tags.php#L41\r\n\r\necho some_get_svg( array( 'icon' =&gt; 'twitter' ) );</pre>\n<p>There is one big problem in this method also. IE browsers (Edge does) doesn&#8217;t support external SVG in <code>&lt;use&gt;</code>. Luckily there is polyfill called <a href=\"https://github.com/Keyamoon/svgxuse\">svgxuse</a> and it&#8217;s licensed by MIT.</p>\n<p>I my tests even Firefox didn&#8217;t show external SVG icons without the svgxuse polyfill. Go figure.</p>\n<h2>SVG social menu</h2>\n<p>We are finally ready to talk about how to use SVG icon in social menu. Let&#8217;s start with with social menu markup. It&#8217;s the same as in <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/08/14/social-nav-menus-part-2\">Justin&#8217;s tutorial</a> but we&#8217;re using rating-full icon (star) as a fallback icon.

For example generated markup inside social menu look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/samikeijonen/\"&gt;\r\n&lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;Follow me on twitter&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;svg class=\"icon icon-twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;\r\n   &lt;use xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#icon-twitter\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/some/404/\">404 page</a> I have experiment where I try to set SVG icon arguments in away that also screen readers could access the icon info.</p>\n<h2>Some theme as an example</h2>\n<p>Uh, that&#8217;s it.

Did you notice that all the lines have their own class: <code>line line-1</code>, <code>line line-2</code>, and <code>line line-3</code>. Now we can target all the lines separately and animate them using pure CSS.</p>\n<p>For the middle line we just fade it in and out using opacity rule. Top line rotates 45 degrees, and bottom line rotates -45 degrees. In the same time we change the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform-origin/\">transform origin</a> so that menu icon looks more like close icon. That&#8217;s it, we&#8217;re done!</p>\n<h2>What about accessibility</h2>\n<p>There are no new tricks what comes to accessibility. I followed these basic rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use button as a toggle button. Not div, span, or any other weird stuff that don&#8217;t have accessibility API build in.</li>\n<li>Set aria-hidden true for the SVG image. There is no need need for the SVG icon be accessible by screen readers.</li>\n<li>In the same time add word &#8220;Menu&#8221; or similar wording inside button element. In my demo I have used <code>screen-reader-class</code> around it.</li>\n<li>Button also have <code>aria-expanded</code> ARIA rule which change it&#8217;s value from false to true depending is the menu opened or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me know if there is something we can improve in this <a href=\"https://codepen.io/samikeijonen/pen/jqvxdL\">simple and accessible SVG hamburger menu animation</a>.</p>\n","<p>We could argue should we ever use so called hamburger icon as a menu toggle button.

So my decision definitely didn&#8217;t come out of the blue sky. And I had already build <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/category/themes/\">public themes</a> since 2012. I also had some client work while working as a teacher.</p>\n<p>I was getting ready mentally and financially.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was ready for it. I had the confidence that I can pull this off.</li>\n<li>There was money in my company bank account. It meant that I could pay my own salary even if I didn&#8217;t get freelance work in first months.</li>\n<li>I wanted to try something totally different.</li>\n<li>I wanted to challenge myself (paying my first paycheck felt goooood).</li>\n<li>I wanted to learn more about WordPress and web.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My starting point about business</h2>\n<p><iframe title=\"Vaffanculo al marketing: Bill Hicks (sub) ITA\" width=\"580\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/raFs7Ghf_Dc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Do I really need to say more.

Here is another great example about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdf8UvkjUbc\">army in the world</a>.</p>\n<h2>Before you start your freelancing</h2>\n<p>Like I said before, I had prepared myself several years before I had the courage of trying full time freelancing. Here is a short list what I think you should consider before starting freelancing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t do it on your own, you need help.</li>\n<li>First, find a good book-keeper. I (and book-keeper) use <a href=\"https://netvisor.fi/\">Netvisor</a> for everything: invoicing, taxes, salary, travelling expenses.</li>\n<li>You need to have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDtynWX-vCM\">master plan</a>. What are you actually going to do.</li>\n<li>Focus on 1-2 areas: design, front-end, back-end, integrations, WordPress services, content writing etc.</li>\n<li>As a freelancer you can’t start everything from scratch. Learn something really well before you go for it. In my case it’s just good old HTML, CSS, and WordPress theming.</li>\n<li>Support from your family and friends doesn&#8217;t hurt.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to get freelance jobs?</h2>\n<p>You need to have connections, connections, and connections. And then you need to have connections.</p>\n<p>I got my first freelance job from my brother. They wanted <a href=\"http://www.ortonpro.fi/\">new website</a>, and I was the perfect fit for the job. After the project was done and I had already invoiced, &#8220;funny&#8221; thing happened. My brother&#8217;s boss called him in his office and conversation went like this:</p>\n<p>&#8211; So, your brother build our new website?<br />\n&#8211; Yes.<br />\n&#8211; Hmmmm, site does look nice.<br />\n&#8211; Thanks.<br />\n&#8211; But there is this one thing I&#8217;d like to discuss.<br />\n&#8211; Okay, what?<br />\n&#8211; You are in the board of your brother&#8217;s company!<br />\n&#8211; What, I am?<br />\n&#8211; Oh yes you are, and that&#8217;s not good. I mean it&#8217;s not illegal to hire company where you are in the board. But it sure is unethical.<br />\n&#8211; Yes Sir.</p>\n<p>Here are other things how to get freelance jobs in one form or another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subcontracting for other companies.</li>\n<li>Help others, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">contribute to WordPress</a>.</li>\n<li>Have online portfolio.</li>\n<li>You own site better not suck.</li>\n<li>Be active, not aggressive.</li>\n<li>Get involved in WordPress scene: meetups, WordCamps, speak, teach, write.</li>\n<li>Sounds lame but <strong>be yourself</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why hire a freelancer?</h2>\n<p>I asked one of my client (which is the best one I had so far) questions about freelancing. More detailed Show Case post is coming soon. I&#8217;m just going to copy paste all his answers, they really resonated in my own thoughts.</p>\n<h3>1. Why did you decide to hire freelancer but not digital agency?</h3>\n<p>We had a clearly defined need – we needed somebody who was capable of handling the technical implementation but design,copy etc. came from elsewhere.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that many agencies actually house an army of freelancers. Even if you went for a big agency, you might end up working with the same person, only with a bigger price tag.</p>\n<h3>2. Pros about hiring a freelancer?</h3>\n<p>The price &amp; quality are right. These folks are able to offer services at a reasonable price without the administrative overhead etc.</p>\n<p>Assuming that you pick the correct person you also get high quality.</p>\n<h3>3. Cons about hiring a freelancer?</h3>\n<p>You have to live with the personnel risk. If something happens to your freelancer or they decide to quit the business, you’d better have a backup plan. Then again, with widely used platforms such as WordPress, this is hardly a problem.</p>\n<p>If you pick the wrong person, you might end up with a pile of “exotic” code that is hard for anyone else to maintain and you can only hope that it works in the first place.</p>\n<h3>4. Why did you decide to hire me?</h3>\n<p>References. You had a decent portfolio + we had a personal recommendation regarding your tech skills. Plus, we liked you as a person. In a team &amp; project such as ours, it’s also important that the chemistry works.</p>\n<p>Also, your price was right. It wasn’t absurdly high but not suspiciously low either. Professionals take pride in their work and price themselves accordingly.</p>\n<h3>5. Any other thoughts about freelancing?</h3>\n<p>References, a good portfolio and word-of-mouth are very important.</p>\n<p>Important for web techies: your a site may be horribly UGLY.</p>\n<p>If you include a site in your references, please also include a short description of what you did for the site.</p>\n<p>You have to be able to keep up with the pace of technological development. I think this is one of the biggest challenges when flying solo as you basically have to do most of the research in your non-billable spare time.</p>\n<p>Do *NOT* become a freelancer unless you’re passionate about what you’re doing. The agencies and monsters like <a href=\"https://www.tieto.com/\">Tieto</a> have jobs for people who “only want a job”.</p>\n<h2>Marketing</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/marketing-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Work on details\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/marketing-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/marketing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/marketing.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>My best marketing tool is to put 110% on every project.

It will help you if something bad happens and you don&#8217;t get paid. And it&#8217;s a good guideline for the project.</p>\n<p>I include at least these details in the contract:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prices. Hour rate or fixed price. I do both.</li>\n<li>50% before, 50% when <strong>your</strong> job is done. Don&#8217;t wait until the site is opened. It might never be opened!</li>\n<li>Timetable.</li>\n<li>What the project includes.</li>\n<li>Other fees like commercial plugin licenses.</li>\n<li>Does project includes support for older IE browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have also tried to sell <strong>maintenance contract</strong> for 100 euros per month. But none have taken so far! It might be because I&#8217;m a freelancer, not a several people company. Anyways, my maintenance contract would include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto backups using service like <a href=\"https://vaultpress.com/\">VaultPress</a>.</li>\n<li>Updates (plugins, core, themes) using service like <a href=\"https://infinitewp.com/\">infinitewp</a>.</li>\n<li>1 hour work / month.</li>\n<li>Versioning (Git). <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a> have free private repos.</li>\n<li>Auto deploy using <a href=\"https://deploybot.com/\">deploybot</a>.</li>\n<li>I don’t have a good staging site system. (big minus for me).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Communicate and educate</h3>\n<p>Communication and working with people is pretty much always the hardest part in any job. Your laptop is the easiest colleague. It&#8217;s your job to communicate and educate the client so work on those skills as much as you can.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with live meeting or workshop if possible.</li>\n<li>Live Skype calls. Or regular phone call is just fine.</li>\n<li>Tools like <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, or email <strong>can</strong> help managing projects. But in some cases there is just too much noise in every channel. At that point it&#8217;s time to turn everything off for a while and actually work on a project.</li>\n<li>No matter what you do, communication is the hardest part.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>My developing tools</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m an old school dude. I can perfectly handle everything using <a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html\">XAMPP</a>, <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.1.html\">Notepad++</a> and browser. That way I can have all the control and I really understand what I&#8217;m doing. Simplicity keeps me focused.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I also use <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> text editor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> or <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> for automated tasks.</li>\n<li>SASS from time to time for bigger projects.</li>\n<li>I use <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">Underscores</a> as a starter theme.

But things can take time and are hard to estimate.</p>\n<h2>Let’s talk about the money</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t why here in Finland we don&#8217;t talk about the money. I&#8217;d like to make an exception and lay down all the numbers. I got nothing to hide.</p>\n<p>While teaching I used to create sites for 600 euros. Now the same kind of site costs 4000-6000 euros. I didn&#8217;t have hourly rate but now it&#8217;s always 60 euros. Here are more detailed <strong>facts from time period 1.8.2015 &#8211; 2.5.2016</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have invoiced 40 720,44 €.</li>\n<li>For 24% tax rate it means 32 839,06€ for my company.</li>\n<li>Expenses 4 400,83€. (mostly book-keeping and insurances)</li>\n<li>Project prices between 500 &#8211; 7000 €.</li>\n<li>Most common price about 2500 &#8211; 4000 €.</li>\n<li>I pay for myself 3000€ / month, 2200€ after taxes.</li>\n<li>As a comparison my teacher (includes summer school, vice principal and all) salary was 5000€, 3100€ after taxes.</li>\n<li>To sum it up: <strong>32 839,06 &#8211; 4 400,83 &#8211; 9*3000 € = 1 438,23 €. I call that success</strong>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/\">this site</a> I have earned 4 553,82€. In <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=foxland\">WordPress.com</a> I have earned about 3000€. I have also paid some designs and invoices via Paypal, so I don’t really know the end result. Paypal drives my book-keeper crazy!</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons about freelancing</h2>\n<p>My client already had good points about freelancing, and here are my own thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In most projects you can work where ever and when ever you want.</li>\n<li>You are your own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujwiWjJLwBg\">master</a>.</li>\n<li>You get to meet different kind of people.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s challenging in a good way.</li>\n<li>It’s kind of risky and stressful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can’t be sick.</li>\n<li>Finding good projects and clients.</li>\n<li>90% of my time it&#8217;s just laptop and me.</li>\n<li>It’s kind of risky and stressful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to keep up?</h2>\n<p>Keep on learning new stuff. Basically that’s your job. I started to <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/where-to-learn-wordpress-development/\">learn WordPress in Themehybrid.com</a>. I can highly recommend it to everybody.</p>\n<p>Some learn by reading. In that case I suggest that you follow all (or some) <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress blogs</a>. For WordPress news join <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a> and read <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/\">WP Tavern</a>. I personally try to read something new in every morning.</p>\n<p>Others learn by doing. Go ahead and build cool stuff and remember to share what you have learnt.</p>\n<h2>My future plans</h2>\n<p>I will go back to school. But only for a half year and I don&#8217;t have that much courses. It means that I try doing two jobs for half year, and then switch back full time freelancing. I have no idea how it will work but that&#8217;s another story to tell!</p>\n<p>At this point I want to thank anyone who have helped me during my freelancer journey. I do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMGoU9NcMo\">salute you</a>!</p>\n","<p>Actually, title should be my first nine months as a freelancer because I started my full time freelancing on August 1st, 2015.

We have amazing team and I&#8217;m thankful to be part of it.</p>\n<p>When you start planning the WordCamp gathering the organizing team is by far the most important first step. There are couple of points why I think our team worked so well together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Previous experience</strong>: <a href=\"https://2015.finland.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Finland 2015</a> (first Wordcamp Finland) was held in Tampere. <a href=\"https://danielkoskinen.com/\">Daniel Koskinen</a> was the lead organizer and I think it was crucial that he wanted to be part of the organizing team also this year. This way we could avoid the same pitfalls and already have knowledge how things work.</li>\n<li><strong>Lead organizer</strong>: In every team there needs to be a leader. Someone who sees the big picture, push us to right direction, keep track of things, communicate to WordPress Foundation, and leads our meetings. That&#8217;s <strong>Marco Martins</strong>. He is brilliant.</li>\n<li><strong>Different kind of people</strong>: Our team had eight people which was perfect amount. We all have different strengths and our roles were well planned.</li>\n<li><strong>We had fun together</strong>: We had one hour Slack meeting almost every week. Sure that&#8217;s important but we also met live several times, and we had fun.</li>\n<li><strong>We could rely on each other</strong>: Organizing WordCamp takes a lot of work, I mean a lot of work. It was important that we could rely on each other and do the tasks on time. We could also ask help if we had other obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, we are a team that enjoy working with each other while having fun.</p>\n<h2>Numbers</h2>\n<p>Even if I&#8217;m a math teacher I have never really &#8220;cared&#8221; about the numbers. Yes numbers are important but there is no beauty without the story behind the numbers. But if you&#8217;re into pure numbers, here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attendees</strong>: 262 (about 30 didn&#8217;t show up)</li>\n<li><strong>Attendees on workshop day</strong>: 40-50</li>\n<li><strong>Organizers</strong>: 8</li>\n<li><strong>Volunteers</strong>: 13 (two of them was not able to come)</li>\n<li><strong>Speakers</strong>: 12</li>\n<li><strong>Sponsors</strong>: 10 + 39 micro sponsors</li>\n<li><strong>Total expenses</strong>: about 12 000 euros (I&#8217;ll update the number when we know the final amount)</li>\n<li><strong>Working hours</strong>: zillion</li>\n<li><strong>Swags</strong>: enough</li>\n<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: Infinite</li>\n<li><strong>Wapuu</strong>: One in a million</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5596\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5596 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wapuu_WordCamp_2016-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Wapuu WordCamp 2016\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wapuu_WordCamp_2016-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wapuu_WordCamp_2016-300x200.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wapuu_WordCamp_2016-768x512.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wapuu_WordCamp_2016.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5596\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit Jaana Björklund</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Venue place</h2>\n<p>After the organizing team is ready it&#8217;s time to search the Venue place. We visited several places, and asked the venue prices (lunch, coffee, staff, chairs). By far the best place for us was <a href=\"http://www.virginoil.fi/\">Virgin Oil</a>. It was the cheapest but in the same time <strong>Virgin Oil staff was super friendly and helpful</strong> from the beginning. Most of the conversation went like this:</p>\n<p>– &#8220;Does this pay extra?&#8221;<br />\n– &#8220;No, we&#8217;re happy to help.&#8221;<br />\n– &#8220;Can we come one day before to set all the things?&#8221;<br />\n– &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll ask our technicians staff to come too.&#8221;<br />\n– &#8220;We are having a pretty good feeling about this place.&#8221;<br />\n– &#8220;That&#8217;s nice to hear, let us know if you need something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thank you Virgin Oil staff for being so awesome!</p>\n<h2>Day before the Conference Day</h2>\n<p>We organized the venue place day before the venue: set tables for sponsors, sorted t-shirts and swags, checked stage, audio, video, and WI-FI (which had some problems in venue day).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5594\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5594\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5594 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WordCamp_Finland_2016_badges-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp Finland 2016 badges\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WordCamp_Finland_2016_badges-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WordCamp_Finland_2016_badges-300x200.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WordCamp_Finland_2016_badges-768x512.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WordCamp_Finland_2016_badges.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit Gennady Kurushin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We were really surprised and flattered that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miss_jwo\">Jenny Wong</a> showed up in Virgin Oil!

I&#8217;ve been doing this kind of workshops:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For clients education is mostly <strong>content related</strong>. For example how to publish posts, what are categories and tags, how to change menu items, and any custom stuff involved.</li>\n<li>Sometimes I help by <strong>consulting</strong>. Should there be custom post types, which membership plugin to use, where should we start, which host to pick.</li>\n<li>Full day <strong>educational workshops</strong> are my favorites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was honored to have full day workshop for digi agency called <a href=\"http://www.bstr.fi/\">BSTR</a>. Be sure to check them out. They are switching to WordPress and wanted help how to build a theme.</p>\n<h2>How to build WordPress theme</h2>\n<p>How to build WordPress theme workshop could easily take 2-4 days. For BSTR we had one day but that&#8217;s better than nothing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half of the time we talked about theory and good practices.</li>\n<li>Other half could have been how to actually build a theme (using <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a> for example). But this time we went trough upcoming WordPress project. Should front page content be populated by metaboxes like <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2\">CMB2</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">ACF</a>, which content should be custom post type and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out building themes <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/who-should-read-this-handbook/\">developers handbook</a> is a great resource.

Not to mentioned that he is also one of the admins in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme Review team</a>. He knows WordPress.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering why I only recommend Themehybrid in this article. The answer is simple, I can only speak from my experience.</p>\n<h2>Why I Recommend Themehybrid</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure when I joined Themehybrid, somewhere around 2010 perhaps. But it&#8217;s the most important reason why I&#8217;m still doing WordPress related stuff. I struggled to find words why Themehybrid has been so important for me. Justin himself <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2015/05/14/the-most-awesomesauce-wordpress-theme-business\">explains it</a> pretty well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Really, it’s because we have a vibrant community of users and developers, standards-based philosophy, focus on education, and cool shit. Theme Hybrid also happens to be one of the oldest- and longest-running theme businesses around. Also, there’s plugins <strong>and</strong> themes; both are 100% $free to download.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For me education is the key point. That&#8217;s why I call Themehybrid as a <strong>WordPress School</strong>. Note that it&#8217;s not typical tutorial site where you can find WordPress related courses. It&#8217;s about community helping each others.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to summarize how I learned WordPress Development in Themehybrid WordPress School.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ask questions</strong>: I didn&#8217;t know much about WordPress. I had a lot of questions and every time Justin or someone else answered. Every single time. And not only answered the questions but gave me ideas, code examples and forced me to understand the issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Read others questions and solutions</strong>: There was a time when I read every <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/board/topics\">topic</a> and tried to understand what was going on. Some day I might have the same issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Read tutorials</strong>: Most of the tutorials are in <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/tags/wordpress\">Justin&#8217;s blog</a> but there are cool stuff in <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/weblog\">Themehybrid blog</a> also.

But it can be attractive and useful in the same way as <a href=\"https://www.marcozehe.de/2015/02/05/advanced-aria-tip-2-accessible-modal-dialogs/\">modal dialog when done right</a>. First step is to make it fit in your site design. Not all sites have a natural place for full screen menu or modal dialog.</p>\n<p>Then work hard creating <strong>accessible</strong> full screen menu and you&#8217;re done! In this article I use <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/munsa/\">Munsa WordPress theme</a> as an example. From <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/munsa/\">demo site</a> you can check the final result.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility for sighted users</h2>\n<p>For sighted users there are couple of important points we should consider when creating full screen navigation.</p>\n<p>First, remember color contrast. Menu buttons and link colors should have enough color contrast against background color. Also follow other <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">accessibility guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, disable scrolling on <code>html</code> or <code>body</code> element is probably good idea when you open full screen menu. That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to scroll body element or have two scroll bars when full screen menu is opened. You can do that using one line of CSS when adding class <code>disable-scroll-when-menu-is-open</code> via Javascript:</p>\n<pre>.js.disable-scroll-when-menu-is-open {\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>In the same time take care that you can scroll the navigation element if it&#8217;s taller than site body element. Otherwise users could not reach all the menu items.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5172\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5172\" style=\"width: 707px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/no-scroll-bar.png\" alt=\"no scroll bar \" width=\"707\" height=\"247\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5172\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5172\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">There is no scroll bar so we can&#8217;t reach all the menu items.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Fix this using overflow CSS rule:</p>\n<pre>.js .main-navigation {\r\n    overflow: auto;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>Did you notice the <code>js</code> class? We talk about that in next chapter.</p>\n<h2>Full screen navigation should work when Javascript is disabled</h2>\n<p>Sometimes users disable Javascript or it just doesn&#8217;t load. These users should still be able to see full screen menu items. This can be achieved by adding <code>no-js</code> class to HTML element. When Javascript is available, change <code>no-js</code> to <code>js</code> class programmatically. In <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/\">Twenty Sixteen</a> WordPress Theme this done via <code>wp_header</code> hook.</p>\n<pre>\r\nfunction twentysixteen_javascript_detection() {\r\n\techo \"&lt;script&gt;(function(html){html.className = html.className.replace(/\\bno-js\\b/,'js')})(document.documentElement);&lt;/script&gt;\\n\";\r\n}\r\nadd_action( 'wp_head', 'twentysixteen_javascript_detection', 0 );\r\n</pre>\n<p>After that it&#8217;s a matter of styling the full screen menu using <code>no-js</code> or <code>js</code> classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: In Chrome you can disable Javascript by entering URL <code>chrome://chrome/settings/content</code>. From there check <em>Do not allow any site to run Javascript</em>.</p>\n<h2>Use buttons for opening and closing menu</h2>\n<p>Article <a href=\"http://www.karlgroves.com/2013/05/14/links-are-not-buttons-neither-are-divs-and-spans/\">Links are not buttons. Neither are DIVs and SPANs</a> sums it up really well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DIVs and SPANs do not have accessibility properties build in.</li>\n<li>Links are for navigating to another page or same page anchor. Empty or invalid href attribute doesn&#8217;t make it a button.</li>\n<li>Buttons trigger an action like opening and closing full screen menu.</li>\n<li>Buttons are keyboard accessible by default and yes, they can be styled with CSS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all that said use buttons for triggering full screen menu.</p>\n<h2>Initial focus</h2>\n<p>When full screen menu is closed menu items should not be keyboard focusable when tabbing trough the site using Tab or Shift+Tab. This is because keyboard users might get lost where they are navigating. This can be done by using <code>display: none</code> and <code>display: block</code> CSS on menu element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>display: none</code> when menu is closed.</li>\n<li><code>display: block</code> when menu is opened. Now menu items are focusable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s even more important to shift focus when toggling full screen menu.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When opening the menu (using button toggle) focus should shift on the element itself or the first focusable item inside the menu.</li>\n<li>When closing the menu focus should shift back to element where we were. That&#8217;s probably toggle button. Otherwise it&#8217;s really frustrating for keyboard users to figure out where to hell they landed and start tabbing again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Keeping focus inside full screen menu</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5178\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus-1024x253.jpg\" alt=\"Keep focus inside accessible full screen menu\" width=\"1024\" height=\"253\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5178\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus-1024x253.jpg 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus-300x74.jpg 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus-768x189.jpg 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/keep-focus.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>When tabbing through menu items <strong>do not lose focus outside the full screen menu</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When pressing Tab key on last focusable element focus back to first focusable element. Or to toggle button.</li>\n<li>When pressing Shift+Tab on first focusable element focus back to last focusable element. Or to toggle button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Closing the full screen menu when pressing Escape key</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to provide users an escape route and close the menu when they want. Close button should be part of the focusable elements inside full screen menu. But also close the menu when user press <strong>Escape key</strong>. And remember to shift focus back to where it was in this case also.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/esc-for-closing.jpg\" alt=\"Pressing Escape key closes the full screen menu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"337\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5181\" /></p>\n<h2>But where is the code?</h2>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to put too much code examples in this article.

One at the top and another one at the botton of the page. Those are good for example promoting tickets for next game.</p>\n<p>Cool thing about Callout sections is that you can set background images, color and color opacity for them.</p>\n<p>Note that you can even show videos in Callout section in the same was as in post content: Enter youtube URL in it&#8217;s own line.</p>\n<p>You can show latest blog posts or child pages of front page in Front Page Template. There is also widget area available.</p>\n<h3>Layout, sidebars and widgets</h3>\n<p>Theme has one column layout by default but it can have two column layout also. Sidebar on the left or the right side of the content. There are four widget areas in the theme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary sidebar which dictates the two column layout.</li>\n<li>Header widget area which is toggled open and closed.</li>\n<li>Footer widget area at bottom of the site.</li>\n<li>Front Page widget are in Front Page template.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Menus</h3>\n<p>Primary menu is at the top of the page. It&#8217;s divided in two menu locations: <strong>Top left menu</strong> and <strong>Top right menu</strong>. On larger screens toggle buttons are in the middle of the menus. On narrow screens Menu toggle button opens both of the menus.</p>\n<p>Social links menu have two locations. One at the top (behind toggle button), and another one at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<h3>Footer settings</h3>\n<p>You can enter your own custom text in the footer or hide the footer text.

Have you ever wondered how user specific settings work in <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network\">multisite</a>? Do you want settings to be global and shared across all sub sites? Or do you need to retrieve the user meta setting for the current site where the user meta setting can be different in all sub sites?</p>\n<p>Luckily WordPress covers all these scenarios. Let&#8217;s start with <code>*_user_meta()</code> functions.</p>\n<h2>Global user meta</h2>\n<p>In user profile page we already have several WordPress core settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Color Scheme</li>\n<li>First Name</li>\n<li>Last Name</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4989\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-4989\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile-1024x580.png\" alt=\"User Profile Page\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile-1024x580.png 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile-300x170.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile-768x435.png 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/User-profile.png 1496w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you update <em>First Name</em>, the value is changed for all sub sites. That makes perfect sense, your name remains the same in all sub sites. I call that global user setting.</p>\n<h2>How to set global custom user meta</h2>\n<p>Sometimes we want to add our own settings in the user profile page. Custom user meta can be for example occupation, expire date in membership sites, or checkbox for approving the user.</p>\n<p>There are four functions for adding, updating, retrieving or deleting custom user meta:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_user_meta\">Add user meta</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_user_meta\">Update user meta</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_user_meta\">Get user meta</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/delete_user_meta\">Delete user meta</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In our example we add simple text where <strong>meta key</strong> is called <code>multisite_user_meta_setting</code>.</p>\n<pre>$user_id    = 1;\r\n$meta_key   = 'multisite_user_meta_setting';\r\n$meta_value = 'Sample text';\r\nadd_user_meta( $user_id, $meta_key, $meta_value );\r\n</pre>\n<p>Setting is saved in database table called <code>wp_usermeta</code>. Now we could update, get or delete <strong>meta value</strong> but that&#8217;s not focus in this tutorial. If we use the same code in multisite install everything stays the same. User meta value remains as global setting across all sub sites.</p>\n<h2>User meta in WordPress multisite</h2>\n<p>In previous chapter we used <code>*_user_meta()</code> functions but there are also <code>*_user_option()</code> functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_user_option\">Update user option</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_user_option\">Get user option</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/delete_user_option\">Delete user option</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These functions checks against a site-specific meta key first, but if it doesn&#8217;t find anything, it falls back to a user-wide meta key. It means that same user can have different meta values for the same setting in multisite. For example we can have membership site in multisite install and expire date can be different in all sub sites when using <code>*_user_option()</code> functions.</p>\n<h2>How does user meta works in multisite</h2>\n<p>We can use the same example as before but instead of using <code>add_user_meta()</code> we use <code>update_user_option()</code> function.</p>\n<pre>$user_id     = 1;\r\n$option_name = 'multisite_user_meta_setting';\r\n$new_value   = 'Sample text';\r\nupdate_user_option( $user_id, $option_name, $new_value );\r\n</pre>\n<p><code>update_user_option</code> function <strong>prepend the WordPress table prefix to the option name</strong> automatically. This is what happens behind the scenes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let&#8217;s say our table prefix is <code>sk_</code></li>\n<li>Main site of multisite (and in single installs) meta key looks like this: <code>sk_multisite_user_meta_setting</code></li>\n<li>In sub site there is also <strong>blog ID</strong> in the prefix. Meta key in sub site (where ID is 7) looks like this: <code>sk_7_multisite_user_meta_setting</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you can retrieve different meta values automatically and WordPress takes care of prefixing:</p>\n<pre>// Get setting\r\n$setting = get_user_option( 'multisite_user_meta_setting', $user_id );\r\n</pre>\n<p>WordPress checks the prefix in sub site where blog ID is seven (7) in this order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>sk_7_multisite_user_meta_setting</li>\n<li>sk_multisite_user_meta_setting</li>\n<li>multisite_user_meta_setting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So it even works when you switch from <code>*_user_meta()</code> to <code>*_user_option()</code> functions because WordPress automatically falls back for non prefixed meta key. How cool is that!</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>I used similar method in my <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/edd-members/\">EDD Members</a> add-on which is now multisite compatible. I also created a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/63d1bd862adc69786936\">sample plugin</a> how you could use this idea in your own projects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/example-setting.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4999\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4999\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/example-setting.png\" alt=\"Example user setting\" width=\"777\" height=\"163\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/example-setting.png 777w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/example-setting-300x63.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/example-setting-768x161.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for today, cheers!</p>\n","<p>Have you ever needed to save user specific data in WordPress?

But I don&#8217;t think they even ask you if you want your theme in WordPress.com. They most likely pick themes that looks good and seems a good fit.</p>\n<p>So all you have to do is create awesome themes, <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/do-it-yourself-theme-review/\">review them first</a> and send them to WordPress.org and hope for the best!</p>\n<p>What about <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sort/premium/\">commercial themes</a>? There is <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/join/\">submit your theme page</a> but it was only open short time period, and the year was 2014. From my understanding <strong>new theme shops are only invited</strong> at the moment. They most likely check out theme shops from time to time and decide to invite new theme shops if they really really like your work.</p>\n<p>Or you can always contact them directly and let them know you&#8217;re <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWygxReD_w\">the best of the best</a>!</p>\n<p>By the way there are 181 commercial themes and  39 theme shops in WordPress.com. It means less than five theme average per theme shop at the time I&#8217;m writing this (January 2016).</p>\n<p>I was originally invited by <a href=\"http://philiparthurmoore.com/\">Philip Arthur Moore</a> and week after that <a href=\"http://philiparthurmoore.com/2014/02/01/im-leaving-automattic-inc/\">he quit his job at Automattic</a>. I thank him for that! Not leaving his job but giving me the opportunity.</p>\n<h2>WordPress.com theme review process</h2>\n<p>When you get in to WordPress.com that&#8217;s only the beginning. There are several steps before your theme is actually live. In short the theme review process looks like this:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Upload your theme</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4940\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4940\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-4940\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upload-theme-1024x378.png\" alt=\"Upload theme\" width=\"1024\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upload-theme-1024x378.png 1024w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upload-theme-300x111.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upload-theme-768x283.png 768w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upload-theme.png 1112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4940\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Upload your theme for review</figcaption></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Send your theme&#8217;s .zip file trough Themer Lobby Dashboard. That&#8217;s a custom tool they are using.</li>\n<li>Theme will be automatically scanned. I think they are using custom, combined tools from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">theme check plugin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-scanner\">VIP scanner</a>.</li>\n<li>Provide demo site URL and theme price.</li>\n<li>WordPress.com theme review team will run through an initial review of a theme and <strong>can reject the theme</strong> at this first step. First step review is mostly about the design.</li>\n<li>For example <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/toivo/\">Toivo</a> theme was rejected because it was, how do you say it, ugly. I was adviced to look at their top themes what users would like. <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/munsa/\">Munsa</a> theme was rejected because it looked too much the same as some of their themes. That&#8217;s what I call irony 🙂</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From initial review, which takes about 4-14 days, you can get three kind of responses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Yes</strong>: Oh yes, this is awesome!</li>\n<li><strong>Perhaps</strong>: There are potential in this theme but needs some changes and polishing. Could you fix these issues?</li>\n<li><strong>No</strong>: Are you crazy? Why would you ever think we would want your shitty theme in our glorious platform!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Jokes aside, it would actually be nice to know what percentage of themes get approved.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Review</h2>\n<p>If your theme is accepted, the actual theme review starts. It&#8217;s intense, only <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/themereview-co-theme-review/\">themereview.co</a> can compete with that. I mean they will rip your theme in pieces, turn it upside down, jump on it, feed it to bears and see if the theme can make it.</p>\n<p>Technical part looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They will give you commit access to <strong>review SVN repository</strong>. Yes, they are using SVN, not Github.</li>\n<li>They will assign one theme wrangler to review your theme. Then reviewer open new issues in the SVN repo and your job is to solve them.</li>\n<li>Reviewer will go over every line of code in your theme.</li>\n<li>After that reviewer go over every detail in theme design and test it on WordPress.com unit test data.</li>\n<li>When this review is mostly done, final review will move over to <strong>live SVN repository</strong>.</li>\n<li>When on live repo reviewer starts looking at the WordPress.com specific stuff:\n<ul>\n<li>Custom Widgets design for WordPress.com. Those inline styles and !important CSS rules ain&#8217;t no fun.</li>\n<li>Check support for <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-design/custom-colors/\">custom colors</a> and <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/custom-fonts/\">fonts</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 2 can take several weeks or months depending on lot&#8217;s of different factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long does it take to start step 2.</li>\n<li>How fast can you fix the issues.</li>\n<li>How much there are other responsibilities for you and the reviewer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 3: Accessibility review</h3>\n<p>I try my best to <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/feature/accessibility-ready/\">create accessible WordPress themes</a>. I was so happy to hear that all reviewers make suggestion to improve accessibility:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All the reviewers make suggestions to improve accessibility when doing regular reviews (for things like menu toggles, and keyboard navigation), even if the theme doesn&#8217;t have an accessibility-ready tag.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have the <code>accessibility-ready</code> tag in my theme and therefore <a href=\"http://davidakennedy.com/\">David Kennedy</a> did in depth accessibility review. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">Accessibilty guidelines</a> are the same as in WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>For me there wasn&#8217;t any big issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small color contrast tweaks.</li>\n<li>Better headings for screen readers.</li>\n<li>Better keyboard navigation support inside off-canvas sidebar. This was great lesson for me, I&#8217;ll write separate post about this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 4: Showcase and documentation review</h2>\n<p>Every theme have their own <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/sonsa/\">Showcase</a> and <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/themedoc/sonsa/\">Documentation</a> page. They have <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/themes/documentation-style-guide/\">guidelines how to write good documentation</a>. All I can say that my initial documentation was not very good. I got over ten improvements ideas and reviewer also edited the docs. I&#8217;ll thank her in the next chapter. She was amazing.</p>\n<p>After our improvements editorial team checked showcase and documentation pages. We got another round of ideas how to make them even better. And we did. Launching the theme was getting closer and closer.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Launching the Sonsa theme</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4914\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sonsa-theme.jpg\" alt=\"Sonsa Theme\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sonsa-theme.jpg 640w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sonsa-theme-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<p>First I want to thank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurelfulford\">Laurel Fulford</a> for excellent review! I felt like we were on the same page and working hard to polish <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/sonsa/\">Sonsa</a> theme. It&#8217;s definitely a lot better theme after the review process. And now <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/themes/sonsa/\">Sonsa is also available at WordPress.com</a>. High five, we did it!</p>\n<p>I really liked her attitude and how she presented the ideas. Compare the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I noticed an issue when testing on several browsers and devices. Here are screenshots. Have you considered that we could fix this by doing this kind of improvements? Or did you have other ideas for this?</li>\n<li>This needs to be fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which one would you prefer? For me the helpful review process is really important, not just that I get my theme approved.

In this article we&#8217;re going to take a closer look <strong>how to make multi-level dropdown menu more accessible</strong> in the same time. If you want to jump right into the end results, here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js/tree/dropdowns\">Github repo</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://samikeijonen.github.io/responsive-nav.js/demos/multiple-levels/\">Live demo</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/issues/178\">Original issue</a> for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Goals for our accessible responsive multi-level dropdown menu</h3>\n<p>We talked about <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">how to create better, more accessible WordPress themes</a> before. And I wrote about the ideas what I&#8217;d like to see in <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/accessible-and-responsive-navigation-patterns/\">accessible navigations patterns</a>. In this example we&#8217;re going to take a closer look at dropdown menus. We use <a href=\"http://responsive-nav.com/\">Responsive Nav</a> by <a href=\"http://viljamis.com/\">Viljami Salminen</a> as our base navigation. It has several advantages build in already:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s lightweight.</li>\n<li>Doesn’t require any external Javascript library like jQuery.</li>\n<li>Works without Javascript too.</li>\n<li>Removes the 300 ms delay between a physical tap and the click event.</li>\n<li>Have been tested and works in all major desktop and mobile browsers, even IE 6.</li>\n<li>Have CSS3 transition build in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responsive Nav already has <a href=\"https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/tree/multiple-levels\">multi-level branch</a> but I wanted to <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js/tree/dropdowns\">create my own fork</a> out of the master branch for better accessibility. My goals for accessible responsive multi-level dropdown menu looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better support for keyboard users.</li>\n<li>Better support for screen reader users.</li>\n<li>Using buttons instead of links for toggling.</li>\n<li>Try to remove 300 ms delay on dropdown buttons also.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate that <a href=\"http://deep.design/the-hamburger-menu/\">we don&#8217;t always need hamburger</a> icon.</li>\n<li>Use more ARIA markup.</li>\n<li>Still works without Javascript.</li>\n<li>Still doesn’t require any external Javascript libraries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also wanted to build it with WordPress and other CMS platforms in mind. They normally use predefined classes in menu items and sub menus. That&#8217;s why I added new options for changing them. You can check examples from <a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js/blob/dropdowns/README.md\">readme file</a>.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started, shall we.</p>\n<h3>Better support for keyboard users on larger screens</h3>\n<p>On <strong>larger screens</strong> we&#8217;re used to access sub menu items using mouse hover effect. We want to same effect for keyboard users who navigates links using the Tab, Shift + Tab and Enter keys. In many cases you can&#8217;t access to sub menu items using keyboard. Let&#8217;s fix that in the same way as we talked before when creating <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">more accessible themes</a>.</p>\n<p>Once again we use Underscores toggleFocus() from <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/master/js/navigation.js\">navigation.js file</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a menu link is focused or blurred, set or remove the <code>.focus</code> class on the menu link. This is done with the <code>toggleFocus()</code> function.</li>\n<li>Add class <code>.focus</code> in your stylesheet, where you have <code>:hover</code> styles for the menu.</li>\n<li>You can now navigate your menu and sub menus using the <code>tab</code> and <code>Shift + tab</code> key.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end I&#8217;d also like to have arrow key support for navigation.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard users on smaller screens</h3>\n<p>When menu is collapsed we still need to access sub menu items using keyboard. This is the basic idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We add dropdown toggle buttons using Javascript. This way we don&#8217;t have to worry about them in our markup and dropdown menu would still work even if Javascript is disabled.</li>\n<li>We add the same events to dropdown buttons as in menu toggle button.</li>\n<li>We can open the sub menu using Enter key and tab trough to sub menu items.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-3931 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-large'><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://foxland.foxnet.fi/accessible-multi-level-dropdown-navigation/mobile-menu-with-js-off/'><img width=\"435\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-off.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Mobile menu when javascript is disabled\" loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-4817\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-off.png 435w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-off-149x300.png 149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-4817'>\n\t\t\t\tMobile menu when javascript is disabled\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption></figure><figure class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<div class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://foxland.foxnet.fi/accessible-multi-level-dropdown-navigation/mobile-menu-with-js-on/'><img width=\"434\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"Mobile menu when javascript is enabled\" loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-4818\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on.png 434w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on-150x150.png 150w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on-300x300.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on-100x100.png 100w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mobile-menu-with-js-on-50x50.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-4818'>\n\t\t\t\tMobile menu when javascript is enabled\n\t\t\t\t</figcaption></figure>\n\t\t</div>\n\n<p>Note that sub menu toggle is not just basic click event but we use the same events as in Responsive nav menu toggle. For me the biggest change is that toggle works even on &#8220;clumsy&#8221; clicks. Basically you can hold the button for a while and when our finger leaves the button, menu or sub menu opens. Now even my Mom can open the menu and sub menus. Hi Mom!</p>\n<p>Then I run into another issue.</p>\n<h3>Focus on sub menu items</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samikeijonen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@samikeijonen</a> am a screen reader user &amp; without me activating the menu, why my focus moves to a sub menu during tab?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Raghavendra Satish P (@artofvision) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artofvision/status/633933173898870784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Check for <a href=\"https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/\">Twenty Fifteen demo</a> where you can access the sub menu items using keyboard Tab and Enter <strong>only if you open the sub menu first</strong>. In my case you could access sub menu items without opening the sub menu first.</p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artofvision\">@artofvision</a> mentioned probably Twenty Fifteen logic for sub menus is what most people expect. But how do we achieve that? Only method I could think of is using <code>display: none</code> for sub menus. And when toggling sub menu open, we overwrite that using <code>display: block</code>.</p>\n<p>Is there any better way for handling focus on sub menus? Is this the most accessible solution? I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking 🙂</p>\n<p>All I know that it gives some troubles for CSS animations for drop downs I had in mind. One solution could be use <code>visibility</code> CSS rule.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit: </strong>For navigation I went with <code>visibility</code> CSS rule and it works great. But for sub menus I need to figure out how to calculate height of the sub menu. Otherwise <code>max-height</code> and <code>visibility</code> CSS rules don&#8217;t play nicely together what it comes for smooth animation.</p>\n<h3>Touch devices</h3>\n<p>We haven&#8217;t even discussed about touch devices yet. Have you tried accessing sub menu items using iPad when menu is in “Desktop” mode? That is something that have been driving me crazy for years and I still don&#8217;t know the ultimate solution. I do use Javascript to enable &#8220;hover&#8221; touch support but it doesn&#8217;t seem to work in every browser that I&#8217;ve been testing. For example in iPad using Chrome I run in to issues.</p>\n<p>Let us know if you have a solution for touch device dropdown issue. In some cases it even works with pure CSS but does it work in most common device and browser combinations and is it accessible for keyboard users also?</p>\n<p>I have personally used solution found in Underscore theme, branch called <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s/blob/fixMenuTouchTaps/js/navigation.js\">fixMenuTouchTaps</a>.</p>\n<h3>ARIA markup</h3>\n<p>There are several ARIA markup added in the navigation that&#8217;ll help screen reader users to get better understanding of our menu system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>aria-expanded=\"true\"</code> or <code>aria-expanded=\"false\"</code> are added dynamically to buttons that toggles the menu or submenus. Same ARIA attribute is also added to navigation itself. These attributes are removed from menu toggle button on &#8220;Desktop&#8221; screen. This is done inside resize function.</li>\n<li><code>aria-haspopup=\"true\"</code> is added to menu items with submenus.</li>\n<li><code>aria-controls=\"nav-id-name\"</code> can be added via settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Using multi-level dropdown navigation in WordPress theme</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js/blob/dropdowns/README.md\">Readme file</a> have basic examples how to use multi-level dropdown menu and the end result can look like in the <a href=\"http://samikeijonen.github.io/responsive-nav.js/demos/multiple-levels/\">demo</a>.</p>\n<p>We can do the same in WordPress Theme. In <code>functions.php</code> file we use <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_enqueue_scripts\">wp_enqueue_scripts</a> hook to enqueue our javascript files. Here is <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/e5dc51eb477e584761fa#file-multi-level-dropdown-php\">the example gist file</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that we&#8217;re using <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script\">wp_localize_script</a> function to pass localized parameters to our <code>functions.js</code> file. And this is how <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/e5dc51eb477e584761fa#file-functions-js\"><code>functions.js</code> file can look like</a>.</p>\n<p>We can also have more that one menu and some of them could have <code>enableDropdown</code> set to <code>false</code>.</p>\n<h4>Overview of the new settings</h4>\n<p>There are several new settings compared to original Responsive Nav.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>enableFocus: false</code>, // Boolean: Do we add &#8216;focus&#8217; class in nav elements</li>\n<li><code>enableDropdown: false</code>, // Boolean: Do we use multi level dropdown</li>\n<li><code>menuItems: \"menu-items\"</code>, // String: Class that is added only to top ul element</li>\n<li><code>subMenu: \"sub-menu\"</code>, // String: Class that is added to sub menu ul elements</li>\n<li><code>openDropdown: \"Open sub menu\"</code>, // String: Label for opening sub menu</li>\n<li><code>closeDropdown: \"Close sub menu\"</code>, // String: Label for closing sub menu</li>\n<li><code>resizeMobile: function(){}</code>, // Function: Resize callback for &#8220;mobile&#8221;</li>\n<li><code>resizeDesktop: function(){}</code>, // Function: Resize callback for &#8220;desktop&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default multi-level dropdown is set to false because of the backwards compatibility. Play around with the settings and see what fits to your project.</p>\n<h4>Using dropdown setting in the Customizer</h4>\n<p>We could even <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/e5dc51eb477e584761fa#file-customizer-php\">add setting in the Customizer </a>where site owner can disable or enable multi-level dropdown menu.</p>\n<p>This is useful if you have only one sub menu in your navigation with few menu sub menu items. In this case you can add new parameter to <code>wp_localize_script</code> function.</p>\n<p><code>'dropdown' =&gt; get_theme_mod( 'disable_dropdown' ) ? false : true</code></p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/e5dc51eb477e584761fa#file-customizer-dropdown-php\">full code example for that</a>. And in functions.js file you could have this setting.</p>\n<p><code>enableDropdown: navSettings.dropdown</code></p>\n<p>Here is full code example for <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/e5dc51eb477e584761fa#file-dropdown-functions-js\">enabling dropdown setting via Customizer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Building accessible multi-level dropdown navigation is not easy, at least not for me. While there are lot&#8217;s of solutions out there already I hope this example gives you ideas what we should look for and how to use it in WordPress theme. I have used this method in couple of client sites and in <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/toivo/\">Toivo theme</a>.</p>\n<p>For me this project was also very important learning process. I basically suck at Javascript and I needed to get my hands dirty to learn more.</p>\n<p>You can find the code and demo in the following links if you want to test it out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js/tree/dropdowns\">Github repo</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://samikeijonen.github.io/responsive-nav.js/demos/multiple-levels/\">Live demo</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js/issues/178\">Original issue</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to use it in your projects also but note that this is not official branch for Responsive Nav and I might have to change something when I play around it more.</p>\n<p>Like I said in the beginning the best navigation is probably without multi-level dropdown sub menus. Then again I think my next project could be accessible off-canvas menu.

But how do we know which are good role model themes? Themes that follow best practices, uses latest WordPress functions and are up to date. I have had three main sources for learning how to code themes.</p>\n<p>I started learning from <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Themehybrid</a> themes by <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/\">Justin Tadlock</a>. At first I just tried to understand the code, then build some child themes, and finally have enough skills to build my own parent themes. I highly recommend Themehybrid for everybody. You can ask any questions in the Forums or Slack channel. And you will be answered!</p>\n<p>WordPress default themes are also great source for latest possibilities in WordPress. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen\">Twenty Sixteen</a> is good example and it only works with WP 4.4+. There are several new tips and trick like these ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/header.php\">header.php</a> file there is example how to enable responsive images in header image.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/comments.php\">comments.php</a> there is new <code>the_comments_navigation()</code> function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Third learning source is <a href=\"https://github.com/automattic/_s\">Underscores</a> theme. It&#8217;s a starter theme by <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>. It has over 100 contributors and usually picks up the latest best practices pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2>Follow the theme review guidelines</h2>\n<p>Even if you are building a theme for clients I would follow theme review guidelines as much as I could.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/\">WordPress.org has it own guidelines</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/themes/\">WordPress.com has extended these a little bit</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It helps you realize what is important and what you should look for when writing your code. Every time I think I&#8217;m really clever with new stuff I go back to guidelines and check if I&#8217;m actually doing something stupid.</p>\n<p>When you start following coding standards and guidelines in the beginning they will become a natural workflow for you. That will help you a lot and you don&#8217;t have to clean up that much of your code afterwards.</p>\n<h2>Debugging your code</h2>\n<p>In your development environment remember to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress\">turn debug mode on</a> in your <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php\">wp-config.php</a> file.</p>\n<pre>define('WP_DEBUG', true);</pre>\n<p>This will help you see PHP errors, notices and warnings, WordPress-generated debug messages, particularly deprecated function usage.</p>\n<p>There are other debugging constants that I use also, like <code>SCRIPT_DEBUG</code>.</p>\n<pre>define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);</pre>\n<p>Core, many plugins and my themes can minimize JavaScript and CSS files. For example there can be original <code>navigation.js</code> file and compressed file <code>navigation.min.js</code>. When <code>SCRIPT_DEBUG</code> is turned on you&#8217;ll load <code>navigation.js</code> file instead of <code>navigation.min.js</code>.</p>\n<p>My current setup looks like this in development environment:</p>\n<pre>define('WP_DEBUG', true);\r\ndefine('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true);\r\ndefine('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);\r\ndefine('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', true);</pre>\n<p>For more information check out <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/2015/10/15/debugging-wordpress-tips-snippets/\">Debugging WordPress Tips and Snippets</a> article by Webdevstudios.</p>\n<h3>Plugins for debugging</h3>\n<p>Other than just turning debugging mode on I also use couple of great plugins to help me out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/\">Developer Plugin</a> recommends you several tools and plugins.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/\">Query Monitor Plugin</a> for debugging queries and performance. And plenty of more! Heck, I even use it live sites sometimes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Automated checks</h2>\n<p>After a while you get blind to your code. Read the lines below out loud. Go a head, it will only take a second.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Remember to follow the<br />\nthe theme review guidelines</p></blockquote>\n<p>Did you notice any mistakes in that text? If not, read it again. Once more.</p>\n<p>The same thing happens when we write code: we don&#8217;t spot our mistakes anymore because we think we got it right in the first place.</p>\n<p>Some of the mistakes can be prevented using automated checks that will go trough your code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check Plugin</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/vip-scanner\">VIP scanner Plugin</a>. Note that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/vip-scanner/\">VIP scanner Plugin in WordPress.org</a> is not maintained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I run both of the plugins every time I make some changes in the code. I also run them in live demo site, not just in my development environment. That&#8217;s because of the extra files I have in development, like <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility review</h2>\n<p>I try to create my <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/feature/accessibility-ready/\">themes as accessible as possible</a>. There are separate <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\">accessibility guidelines</a> for themes which I try to follow right from the start. I even wrote article about <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">accessible themes</a> in Post Status.</p>\n<p>I start my accessibility review by navigating all the elements without mouse and just using keyboard Tab and Enter. Especially <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/accessible-and-responsive-navigation-patterns/\">menu elements needs more attention</a> so you can access menu items, and sub menu items using only keyboard also.</p>\n<p>I suck at testing my themes using screen readers. I&#8217;ll try to improve on this one!</p>\n<p>Here are couple of other tools I use for accessibility testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/\">Color contrast tester</a>.</li>\n<li>Heading map testing for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi?hl=en\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/headingsmap/\">Firefox</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tenon.io/\">Tenon</a> service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-tota11y/\">WP Tota11y</a> Plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Content review</h2>\n<p>For content I use two similar theme test data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test\">Theme unit test data from WordPress.org</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://themetest.wordpress.com/\">Theme test data from WordPress.com</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will help you check to most common use edge cases on your design. Note that real content is always better than test data. I try to check all content that theme test data creates also on mobile, not just on desktop.</p>\n<p>I also check content for <a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/\">valid HTML</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/\">structured data markup</a>. There is no need to get in shock if you see some errors in validators. They are not 100 % correct every time 🙂</p>\n<h2>Final steps</h2>\n<p>Now do everything again but do it on clean, new WordPress install. First without any possible recommended plugins and then with them.</p>\n<p>Go trough every setting you might have in a theme and watch if there are any design problems or PHP notices. This includes WordPress related features like custom header or background.</p>\n<p>Then it&#8217;s time to clean up your code. Open every file in your theme and check your code line by line. I usually start with <code>style.css</code> file because it&#8217;s kind of a mess at this point.</p>\n<p>Finally repeat every steps again. If you&#8217;re crazy like me you might still repeat every steps once more. And once more. And once more.</p>\n<p>Congrats! You have now reviewed your theme and it&#8217;s time to submit your theme to WordPress.org or other marketplaces.</p>\n","<p>I wanted to compare theme review processes and let&#8217;s start what is your role in theme review.

Content Restriction add-on allows you to restrict content on your site to only those users who have purchased your products. EDD Members can <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/docs/setting-edd-members/\">set content private</a> and set membership length in the same time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict Content to page <strong>Important</strong>, where you need to purchase download called <strong>Membership</strong> to access page called Important. That&#8217;s what Restriction Content Plugin do.</li>\n<li>User who purchase Membership can access to page Important.</li>\n<li>In the same same time you have enabled membership length in EDD Members Plugin for Membership download.</li>\n<li>When some day membership will expire, you can&#8217;t access to page Important anymore.</li>\n<li>User who have not purchased Membership can&#8217;t access to page Important no matter what is their membership expire date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty straightforward but I think it was not clear how that works. In other words Content Restriction Plugin is great to give customers access to private page but let&#8217;s say you want to have memberships levels also. Then EDD members steps in. For example you could set 14 days free trial, 30 days access for $30 and 90 days access for $60.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps if you are wondering how <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/content-restriction/\">Content Restriction</a> and <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/edd-members/\">EDD Members</a> works together.</p>\n","<p>Did you know that you can set membership site also using Easy Digital Downloads.

Value can be for example age or expire date. First we&#8217;d need to save numeric info in <code>*_usermeta</code> table. There are handy functions like <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_user_meta\">add_user_meta</a> and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_user_meta\">update_user_meta</a> for doing that. But it&#8217;s outside of this tutorial. Let&#8217;s focus on how you can manage custom sortable columns and sort by <code>meta_value_num</code>.</p>\n<p>There are four steps we need to take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add new custom user column using <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_users_columns\">manage_users_columns</a>.</li>\n<li>Add content to column using <code>manage_users_custom_column</code>.</li>\n<li>Make custom column sortable using <code>manage_users_sortable_columns</code>.</li>\n<li>Sort users based on numeric value in custom column using <code>pre_get_users</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Add custom column</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use expire date, which is stored as <code>strtotime</code>, as an example. First we add custom column using <code>manage_users_columns</code> filter.</p>\n<pre>/**\r\n * Add new user column: Expire Date.\r\n *\r\n * @since  1.0.0\r\n * @return array $columns\r\n */\r\nfunction prefix_expire_date_column( $columns ) {\r\n\t$columns['expire_date']   = __( 'Expire Date', 'text-domain' );\r\n\treturn $columns;\r\n}\r\nadd_filter( 'manage_users_columns', 'prefix_expire_date_column' );\r\n</pre>\n<p>We add new column in users columns array in format <code>name =&gt; label</code>. In our case custom column name is <strong>expire_date</strong>. Let&#8217;s keep that in mind.</p>\n<h2>Add content to custom column</h2>\n<p>Next step is to add content in our custom column. We can do that using <code>manage_users_custom_column</code> filter. It has three parameters: <code>$value</code>, <code>$column_name</code> and <code>$user_id</code>.</p>\n<pre>/**\r\n * Adds Expire date and Status to column.\r\n *\r\n * @since  1.0.0\r\n * @return void\r\n */\r\nfunction prefix_add_custom_columns( $value, $column_name, $user_id ) {\r\n\t\r\n\tif( 'expire_date' == $column_name ) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t/* Get expire date somehow. For example using your custom function */\r\n\t\t$expire_date = prefix_get_expire_date( $user_id );\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t$value = $expire_date;\r\n\t\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\treturn $value;\r\n\t\r\n}\r\nadd_action( 'manage_users_custom_column', 'prefix_add_custom_columns', 10, 3 );\r\n</pre>\n<p>We want to add and return expire date value when our custom column name is the correct one, in our example it was <code>expire_date</code>. In short we first check that our column name is <code>expire_date</code>, then add your content and return the value.</p>\n<h2>Make custom column sortable</h2>\n<p>By default custom column is not sortable. Next we use <code>manage_users_sortable_columns</code> filter to make our custom column sortable.</p>\n<pre>/**\r\n * Add sortable columns.\r\n *\r\n * @since  1.0.0\r\n * @return void\r\n */\r\nfunction prefix_sortable_columns( $columns ) {\r\n\t\r\n\t$columns['expire_date'] = 'expire_date';\r\n\treturn $columns;\r\n\t\r\n}\r\nadd_filter( 'manage_users_sortable_columns', 'prefix_sortable_columns' );\r\n</pre>\n<p>We use our <code>expire_date</code> column again and I prefer to give it the same name. It tells WordPress that our orderby parameter is <code>expire_date</code> and when you click the <strong>Expire date</strong> column our URL turns into this: <code>users.php?orderby=expire_date&amp;order=asc</code>.</p>\n<p>But the last step is the most important one.</p>\n<h2>Sort users based on numeric value</h2>\n<p>Even if we make custom columns sortable nothing really happens when you click the Expire date column. We have to tell WordPress how we want to sort. In WordPress 4.2 sorting by numeric value became much more easier in <code>WP_User_Query</code>. Here is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31265\">core track ticket for more info</a>.</p>\n<p>It means that now we can use <code>meta_value_num</code> in <code>orderby</code> parameter (<code>orderby=meta_value_num</code>).</p>\n<p>In the same time, or in WordPress 4.0.0, there is action hook called <code><strong>pre_get_users</strong></code> which we can use to sort based on numeric value in our custom user column.</p>\n<pre>/**\r\n * Sort by expire date. Meta key is called 'prefix_expiration_date'.\r\n *\r\n * @since  1.0.0\r\n * @return void\r\n */\r\nfunction prefix_sort_by_expiration_date( $query ) {\r\n\t\r\n\tif ( 'expire_date' == $query-&gt;get( 'orderby' ) ) {\r\n\t\t$query-&gt;set( 'orderby', 'meta_value_num' );\r\n\t\t$query-&gt;set( 'meta_key', 'prefix_expiration_date' );\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nadd_action( 'pre_get_users', 'prefix_sort_by_expiration_date' );\r\n</pre>\n<p>We need three things for sorting:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Firts check that our query orderby paramater is <code>expire_date</code>. Note that this could be named for something else but in our case it was the same as column name. We use <code>get()</code> method for retrieving query variable.</li>\n<li>Set <code>orderby=meta_value_num</code> because we wanted to sort by numeric value. We use <code>set()</code> method for setting the parameter.</li>\n<li>Set <code>meta_key=your_meta_key_name</code>. In our example <code>meta_key</code> is called <code>prefix_expiration_date</code>. In here we also use <code>set()</code> method.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can check all the methods and properties in <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_User_Query\">WP_User_Query codex page</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re done.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It took me about two days to figure this out when I needed this feature in <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/edd-members/\">EDD Members</a> add-on.

It got <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/interviewing-reinar-using-toivo-theme/\">really good feedback</a> about it but also some <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/toivo-was-not-approved-in-wordpress-com/\">disappointments</a>. It was time for another experiment and publish Lite version of it. It&#8217;s no secret that <a href=\"http://www.codeinwp.com/blog/transparency-report-1/\">some themes are doing pretty well</a> up selling their Lite version in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress.org</a>. I was curious why <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/\">WordPress.org popular list</a> have those themes in there. You know, not just because they are good themes but what else.</p>\n<h2>Defaults for WordPress.org</h2>\n<p>By default Theme Preview in WordPress.org is not the prettiest experience in the universe. And I doubt it&#8217;ll change anytime soon. First I noticed that many popular themes have messed with front-page.php, home.php or index.php to look a lot better in Theme Preview. I don’t blame them, that seems like a good option to get more downloads and more sails for Pro versions.</p>\n<p>I started to building <code>front-page.php</code> even if I had doubts about it. Chip Bennett have a great article about <a href=\"http://www.chipbennett.net/2013/09/14/home-page-and-front-page-and-templates-oh-my/\">Home and Front Page templates</a>. When I was almost ready I realized I was in the rabbit hole.</p>\n<p>I wanted the .org Preview look like theme&#8217;s <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivocom/\">Front Page Template</a>. That was pretty easy by setting defaults in front-page.php and using some conditional checks explained in Chip&#8217;s article. But in the same time you need to <strong>sacrifice your Front page displays</strong> settings. You just can&#8217;t show your latest post in your front page unless you add additional setting in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t feel right to me. It was bending the default behaviour of WordPress in the wrong way. My finger reached the delete button and puff, there goes pretty Preview out of the window when I deleted front-page.php. I felt sad.</p>\n<p>But could I use other defaults?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set default header image. Check. Doesn&#8217;t exists in Toivo (Pro) theme.</li>\n<li>Set default background, at least for color. Check.</li>\n<li>Set default Widget in sidebar if there is one. I decided to set default widgets for Subsidiary (Footer) Sidebar. Doesn&#8217;t exists in Toivo (Pro) theme.</li>\n<li>Set default values for the Customizer stuff. No need anymore because there is no front-page.php.</li>\n<li>Main menu should display pages as fallback. I personally don’t like this because user might not want to use main menu. And even user leaves the menu empty there would still be HTML markup in the front-end. Doesn&#8217;t exists in Toivo (Pro) theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With those defaults we can have just a little better Previews in WordPress.org.</p>\n<h2>Differences between Toivo and Toivo Lite theme</h2>\n<p>As explained above there are some differences between setting defaults. Other decisions were really hard to make. In the end I just removed couple of features. In Toivo (Pro) theme you can do these compared to Lite version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide or change Footer text. By default there is link to WordPress.org and in my site. Many business sites wants custom text for footer.</li>\n<li>Change Portfolio title and description in <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/portfolio/\">portfolio archive page</a>.</li>\n<li>Add Subsidiary Sidebar Background Image and Color. Looks the same as header image and you can change the color opacity.</li>\n<li>Add Callout section and Callout image at the bottom of Front Page template. This is the template that&#8217;ll probably get some more love in Pro version.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;ll might also add support for team members or similar in Pro version. I haven&#8217;t decided which Plugin I&#8217;m going to use for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me know if you have ideas for better previews in .org or what features would you like to see in Pro versus Lite versions.</p>\n","<p>Few days ago I published theme called Toivo.

I basically started at the same time as <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/\">Justin Tadlock</a> released some of his first WordPress themes in <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Themehybrid</a>. At that time I was very much into Formula One and already had a few commercial contacts within the business and so I decided to make my own website (F1ezine.com).</p>\n<p>As per 2013 I dropped Formula 1 as there were (and still is) way too many websites offering the same concept. So I decided to write about what I do. Leadership, social psychology, behavioural economics, NLP and philosophy. This is who I am and what I stick to today. Sharing knowledge and provoke in a healthy way. Turn things upside down sometimes.</p>\n<p>Milo (milo317), Justin Tadlock, Ben Gilbanks and Darren Hoytt was among those who made me look a little deeper into WordPress as well as their fantastic themes. Let me quickly add to that, that I’m far from a developer and never will be.</p>\n<p>Over the past years I’ve come to the conclusion that content is king and that the themes themselves must be robust, have a solid and reliable foundation (code wise) and have a strategy in which I feel comfortable with. Justin Tadlock has exactly that and quickly I sensed that Sami had all that too. A good healthy attitude of what end-users should and should be able to yet offering a huge playground.</p>\n<p>It’s very much the relationship which matters too and indeed the reliability of the product. I want to feel “safe” when I pick a theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you pick Toivo theme in your site?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, as already mentioned, Sami and Foxland simply offers well coded products and with great ideas of the design too. In addition, my preference to and experience with Hybrid Core means a lot. I simply feel the flexibility and ease of use with Foxland themes.</p>\n<p>By coincidence, Sami let me know that Toivo was coming up, and when I saw the initial demo, I just saw my content fit. And again, I feel that I know exactly what I get when I pay. It’s all that and yet some including but not limited to a fantastic attention and service.</p>\n<p>Toivo actually also challenged me to see my content in a different perspective. Ways of showing and managing my content. I simply love it!</p>\n<p><strong>How long did it take to finish the site when you switched the theme? How was the experience start using Toivo theme?</strong></p>\n<p>To be honest with you, I don’t remember. It all happened so fast. I was running <a title=\"Mina olen\" href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/mina-olen/\">Mina Olen</a> and after previewing Toivo three or four times, I felt I had the right ideas and simply pressed the install button. I think perhaps I spent one day until I was where I wanted to be.</p>\n<p>I’m the touch and feel kind of guy when it comes to these types of things, and it was only very small things that a had to do to get things the way I wanted them. This comes back to my belief about the foundation of Foxland themes, my preferences, the reliability and not least the quality of the work behind it all.</p>\n","<p>Toivo actually also challenged me to see my content in a different perspective.

But now I&#8217;m thrilled to announce my next WordPress Theme called <strong><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/toivo/\">Toivo</a> &#8211;</strong> it means Hope in English. I will always have my Hope! I also have two godsons called Toivo so it has special meaning for me.</p>\n<p>Toivo is a beautiful template for business, personal, portfolio or blog sites. It has powerful Front Page template where you can show your important content, portfolio, testimonials and Callout links.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/\">demo site to see Toivo in action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Accessible WordPress theme</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to say how long I have build this one, at least couple of months. In the process I&#8217;ve been learning more and more about accessibility in WordPress themes and I consider this theme also <strong>accessibility-ready</strong>. If theme is accepted in WordPress.com it will also get official check for accessibility. I&#8217;ll be writing article about learning accessibility in WordPress themes soon.</p>\n<p>Edit: Toivo got official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag and I also wrote an article <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/how-to-create-accessible-wordpress-themes/\">How to create better, more accessible WordPress themes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\n<p>[envira-gallery id=&#8221;3074&#8243;]</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of lot&#8217;s of shiny features in a theme, like build in sliders. But in the same time not all themes should be minimalistic blogging themes. With Toivo I&#8217;ll try to combine both beautiful blogging template and powerful Front Page and Child Page templates for business types of sites. Theme already supports all the WordPress build in features like Custom Header or Background. What else is under the hood?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Powerful <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/\">Front Page Template</a>. You can also Feature only Child Pages in <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/child-pages/\">Child Page Template</a>. There are some cool settings in the Customizer for Front Page Template.\n<ul>\n<li>Set Callout text and link at the top or bottom of the page.</li>\n<li>You can add Callout Image at the bottom of the page.</li>\n<li>By default <strong>Featured Content</strong> is Child Pages of the front page. You can change that to Blog posts or Portfolios from the Customizer.</li>\n<li>You can show (or hide) your testimonials after or before featured content.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You can also add <strong>background image</strong> in the Footer sidebar, not just in the Header. In both places you can <strong>set the color and it&#8217;s opacity</strong> in the Customizer.</li>\n<li>By default layout is one columns but you can change it to two columns layout in the Customizer. Content on the left or right with sidebar.</li>\n<li>Toivo have three menus: Top, Social for your social links and Primary menu. It also has  support for <strong>menu item descriptions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Change <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/portfolio/\">Portfolio archive page</a> title and description.</li>\n<li>Theme also supports right to left languages and <a href=\"http://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a> microdata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Customizer Gallery</h2>\n<p>[envira-gallery id=&#8221;3113&#8243;]</p>\n<h2>Power up your site with Jetpack</h2>\n<p>Lot&#8217;s of people don&#8217;t like Jetpack, I know I didn&#8217;t. But in a way I have changed my mind. We get along pretty well at the moment and it has lot&#8217;s of great tools for users.</p>\n<p>Theme works just fine on it’s own but if you want more features install and activate <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\">Jetpack</a> Plugin. After that you get these features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload your logo.</li>\n<li>Show your <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/testimonial/\">testimonials</a>.</li>\n<li>Show your <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/demo/toivo/portfolio/\">portfolios</a>.</li>\n<li>Add infinite scroll in your blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Theme review</h2>\n<p>Toivo have been reviewed by Justin Tadlock and Emil Uzelac.

With this theme I take the most important step as a developer I have taken so far. It means that theme is accessibility-ready, have right to left support, is translation-ready, support Schema.org microdata and all the WordPress&#8217; built-in theme features and some more. It is my twenty-something theme.</p>\n<p>[envira-gallery id=&#8221;2083&#8243;]</p>\n<p>Kuorinka is combination of <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">_s</a> theme, some of my own experience and some files and ideas from <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\">Hybrid Core</a>. Note that theme doesn&#8217;t use Hybrid Core, only some files from it.</p>\n<p>Theme fits well on business types of sites with clean look but I could imagine bloggers also using the theme. </p>\n<p>By the way Kuorinka is a small lake and village in eastern part of Finland where I crew up. And because there is a project to increase the number of free accessible WordPress themes <a href=\"http://accessiblejoe.com/cities/\">called Cities</a>, I decided the name my theme Kuorinka.</p>\n<h2>Theme settings versus Kuorinka Plus Plugin</h2>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t any theme settings in the theme. I wanted to keep parent theme as simple as it gets. You probably only want to know what image sizes is used in the theme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Header image: 1152 * 500 pixels</li>\n<li>Feature images: 720 * 405 pixels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I was building the theme I was already using it in one of my project. Project had couple of extra things that I needed, for example logo upload and hide footer text. I still didn&#8217;t want to add any settings in the Customizer so my only option was build Plugin for it. <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/kuorinka-plus-2/\" title=\"Kuorinka Plus\">Kuorinka Plus Plugin</a> was born with these extra features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logo upload</li>\n<li>Replace header image with <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/soliloquy-lite/\">Soliloquy Slider</a> in any page or post you want</li>\n<li>Change theme colors in the Customizer</li>\n<li>Change Front Page template settings int the Customizer\n<ul>\n<li>Set Callout text, video and link</li>\n<li>Show icons in Front Page widget area</li>\n<li>Hide posts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove default footer text and add some of your own text</li>\n<li>Better CSS support for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/\">Custom Content Portfolio</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/our-team-by-woothemes/\">Our team</a> CSS</li>\n<li>etc&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Child themes</h2>\n<p>Kuorinka Parent theme is build in a way that child themes are really easy to build.

Even the most simple theme needs to have different Tags in <code>style.css</code> file because WP.com have a little different Tags what they use. And Theme URI is different. Also in WP.com all the Customizer settings needs to be under one section called <strong>Theme</strong>. Well, we can have that in WP.org also even if it feels a little weird. </p>\n<p>Also JS and CSS files can&#8217;t be minified in WP.com because they have their own system for it. And in WP.org version you really want to have minified and compressed JS and CSS files just like in WordPress core. So we&#8217;re back to square one and need to have two different themes even with small changes.</p>\n<p>But I am not gonna give up that easily.</p>\n<h2>Two themes but same code base using Grunt</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been building a new one pager theme called <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/kulkuri/\" title=\"Kulkuri\">Kulkuri</a> and these are the challenges what I&#8217;m facing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have been building <a href=\"https://github.com/devinsays/edd-theme-updater\" title=\"Theme updater\">theme updater</a> and I&#8217;m including it in <code>theme-updater</code> folder.

By clean folder I mean that there is no <code>.git</code> or <code>node_modules</code> folders, <code>package.json</code> or <code>Gruntfile.js</code> files and so on.</p>\n<p>For this I&#8217;m using</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-clean\" title=\"Grunt clean\">grunt-clean</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy\" title=\"Grunt copy\">grunt-contrib-copy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compress\" title=\"Grunt compress\">grunt-contrib-compress</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can check out the example code from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/523f71cb1bdb18762b15#file-grunt-wpcom-js-L66\">gist</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Minify files but don&#8217;t use and include them in WP.com version</strong></p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify\" title=\"Grunt uglify\">uglify</a> for compressing JS and CSS files. But how on earth those will not be used in WP.com? The trick is this.</p>\n<p>`/**<br />\n * Whether or not the current environment is WordPress.com.<br />\n */<br />\nfunction kulkuri_is_wpcom() {<br />\n\treturn ( defined( &#8216;IS_WPCOM&#8217; ) &#038;&#038; true === IS_WPCOM );<br />\n}</p>\n<p>/**<br />\n * The suffix to use for scripts.<br />\n */<br />\nif ( ( defined( &#8216;SCRIPT_DEBUG&#8217; ) &#038;&#038; true === SCRIPT_DEBUG ) || kulkuri_is_wpcom() ) {<br />\n\tdefine( &#8216;KULKURI_SUFFIX&#8217;, &#8221; );<br />\n} else {<br />\n\tdefine( &#8216;KULKURI_SUFFIX&#8217;, &#8216;.min&#8217; );<br />\n}<br />\n`</p>\n<p>I learnt this trick from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/make\" title=\"Make theme\">Make theme</a> by <a href=\"https://thethemefoundry.com/\" title=\"Theme Foundry\">Theme Foundry</a>. After twitter conversation it turns out that this is not allowed in WP.com but what if we don&#8217;t even send .min files to them? I&#8217;ll push my luck and automate this also.</p>\n<p>This is done in part of the <code>copy</code> task.</p>\n<p>`&#8217;!theme-updater/**&#8217;,      // Do not include theme updater in WP.com version.<br />\n&#8216;!style.min.css&#8217;,         // Do not include style.min.css file.<br />\n&#8216;!**/*.min.*&#8217;,            // Do not include .min files.<br />\n&#8216;!languages/kulkuri.pot&#8217;, // Do not include kulkuri.pot in WP.com version.<br />\n`</p>\n<p><strong>Generate different .pot files</strong></p>\n<p>This is also pretty simple using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-wp-i18n\" title=\"makepot\">wp-i18n</a> task because you can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samikeijonen/523f71cb1bdb18762b15#file-grunt-wpcom-js-L46\">exclude folders</a>. In my case I want to generate two different .pot files where in WP.com version we exclude <code>theme-updater</code> folder.</p>\n<p>`makepot: {<br />\n\ttarget: {<br />\n\t\toptions: {<br />\n\t\t\tdomainPath: &#8216;/languages/&#8217;,              // Where to save the POT file.<br />\n\t\t\texclude: [&#8216;build/.*&#8217;, &#8216;buildwpcom/.*&#8217;], // Exlude build folders.<br />\n\t\t\tpotFilename: &#8216;kulkuri.pot&#8217;,             // Name of the POT file.<br />\n\t\t\ttype: &#8216;wp-theme&#8217;                        // Type of project (wp-plugin or wp-theme).<br />\n\t\t}<br />\n\t},<br />\n\ttargetwpcom: {<br />\n\t\toptions: {<br />\n\t\t\tdomainPath: &#8216;/languages/&#8217;,                                  // Where to save the POT file.<br />\n\t\t\texclude: [&#8216;build/.*&#8217;, &#8216;buildwpcom/.*&#8217;, &#8216;theme-updater/.*&#8217;], // Exlude build folders and theme-updater folder.<br />\n\t\t\tpotFilename: &#8216;kulkuriwpcom.pot&#8217;,                            // Name of the POT file.<br />\n\t\t\ttype: &#8216;wp-theme&#8217;                                            // Type of project (wp-plugin or wp-theme).<br />\n\t\t}<br />\n\t}<br />\n},<br />\n`</p>\n<p><strong>Update tags and theme URI for WP.com version</strong></p>\n<p>For this I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https://github.com/yoniholmes/grunt-text-replace\" title=\"Grunt text replace\">text-replace</a>. I will only replace these in the final <code>buildwpcom</code> folder like this.</p>\n<p>`\ttags: {<br />\n\t\tsrc: [<br />\n\t\t\t&#8216;buildwpcom/<%= pkg.name %>/style.css&#8217;<br />\n\t\t],<br />\n\t\toverwrite: true,<br />\n\t\treplacements: [ {<br />\n\t\t\tfrom: /^.*Tags:.*$/m,<br />\n\t\t\tto: &#8216;Tags: green, white, light, one-column, fluid-layout, responsive-layout, custom-background, custom-header, custom-menu, editor-style, featured-images, flexible-header, threaded-comments, translation-ready, infinite-scroll, announcement, business, portfolio, bright, clean, light, modern, playful, professional, tech&#8217;<br />\n\t\t} ]<br />\n\t},<br />\n\tthemeuri: {<br />\n\t\tsrc: [<br />\n\t\t\t&#8216;buildwpcom/<%= pkg.name %>/style.css&#8217;<br />\n\t\t],<br />\n\t\toverwrite: true,<br />\n\t\treplacements: [ {<br />\n\t\t\tfrom: /^.*Theme URI:.*$/m,<br />\n\t\t\tto: &#8216;Theme URI: http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/kulkuri/&#8217;<br />\n\t\t} ]<br />\n\t}<br />\n`</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There is no way to have same theme in WordPress.com and in WordPress.org. But if the theme is simple enough we can use the same code base and auto-generate both themes using Grunt. Or do it manually if you prefer. I already published <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/kulkuri/\" title=\"Kulkuri\">WP.org version of Kulkuri</a> theme for this experiment. And in a minute I&#8217;ll send a WP.com version on it&#8217;s way. I know they can crush my idea in a second and force me to manually keep two different themes. We shall find that out sooner or later and I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>\n<p>Kulkuri wasn&#8217;t accecpted in WP.com so this experiment is coming to the end. Basically they didn&#8217;t want to use WordPress menu system as one page scrolling system.</p>\n<p>I still think using menu system is a good or even the best way for end users having a one page scroller. They suggested to have child pages of Front page but it would be too painful to re-order pages (equals content) in my opinion. But it&#8217;s their site and their rules so there is nothing more to add. I totally respect that.</p>\n","<p>I started my journey in WordPress.com with Mina Olen theme.

At first I felt bad about it because most of my theme knowledge is from <a title=\"Justin Tadlock\" href=\"http://justintadlock.com\">Justin Tadlock</a> and <a title=\"Theme Hybrid\" href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Theme Hybrid</a> community.</p>\n<p>But in the end I kind of started to see my theme development in a new light. I&#8217;ve been so used of using Hybrid Core that I was spoiled. And there were things that I haven&#8217;t realize and understood completely. I left some of the functions and classes from the HC (for example breadcrumb trail script) but I liked how my theme got slimmer and I understood every line of code.</p>\n<p>I think this might be the way I&#8217;m gonna build new themes from now on: take best parts from Hybrid Core and <a title=\"_s theme\" href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/_s\">_s theme</a> and combine them together. These are the arguments why I might take this direction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If they let me having my themes on WP.com, I&#8217;m gonna have to work without Hybrid Core anyway. It takes too much time to have two &#8220;different&#8221; themes, one with HC and one without it.</li>\n<li>Theme is slimmer. Fewer translating strings, less code to handle.</li>\n<li>I can still use best parts of Hybrid Core and made decisions based on theme I&#8217;m building.</li>\n<li>I feel like I have more control over theme and understand every line of code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other review notes</h2>\n<p>Theme review went well and there wasn&#8217;t any major issues. But Kirk is a sharp fellow and there were many things he pointed out to be fixed. I ported most of them also in WP.org version of a theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Escaping</strong></p>\n<p>Escaping the strings comes down to security. I thought I had done all but Kirk found many strings more. Here are examples.</p>\n<p>`get_permalink()` should be `esc_url( get_permalink() ) `.</p>\n<p>`get_the_date()` should be `esc_html( get_the_date() )`</p>\n<p>`get_theme_mod( &#8216;mina_olen_footer&#8217; )` should be `esc_textarea( get_theme_mod( &#8216;mina_olen_footer&#8217; ) )`</p>\n<p><strong>Remove defaults</strong></p>\n<p>There is no need to write the defaults on WP functions. For example declaring Custom header I had these values the same as defaults.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>default-image</li>\n<li>random-default</li>\n<li>header-text</li>\n<li>uploads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same goes for theme customizer. To keep code clean you can remove these defaults.</p>\n<p>`&#8217;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;theme_mod&#8217;` and `&#8217;capability&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;edit_theme_options&#8217;`</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Customizer</strong></p>\n<p>First, all theme-specific options in the Customizer should be in one section in WP.com themes, called &#8220;Theme&#8221;. So I removed all my sections and moved them under same section.</p>\n<p>This part of the theme review was the most educational to me. Did you know that if you want to get all the pages in Customizer you can just use Core `&#8217;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;dropdown-pages&#8217;`, rather than your own custom function like I did. I certainly didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>In Customizer `esc_url` should be replaced by `esc_url_raw` for sanitize_callback, as it&#8217;s being validated into the database, rather than for display.</p>\n<p>For checkbox Kirk showed me really easy way to sanitaze it.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nfunction mina_olen_sanitize_checkbox( $input ) {<br />\nif ( 1 == $input ) {<br />\nreturn 1;<br />\n} else {<br />\nreturn &#8221;;<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n`</p>\n<p>There were also couple of other custom sanitaze functions.</p>\n<h2>Things we get from WordPress.com</h2>\n<p>(This chapter was added March 20, 2014).</p>\n<p>The most important part for me is that I know I have good enough skills developing WordPress Themes. And now I know I can. I had couple of questions before submitting theme to WP.com and I liked the answers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes you can have demo site on WP.com and you can manage the content. Actually you also get sandbox demo site which is pretty cool because you can test all the toys and whistles before they go live.</li>\n<li>You can set the price of a theme. You&#8217;ll get 50% and we get 50%.</li>\n<li>We use SVN for sending theme files. First we use review repo, and then live repo.</li>\n<li>We have themerlobby (for themers only) blog where we update all the important things happening in WP.com theming.</li>\n<li>You should participate in our support forum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>I am</h2>\n<p><em>Mina Olen</em> means <em>I am</em> and theme name was picked up from song. The singer is my all time favourite <a title=\"Kolmas nainen\" href=\"http://www.kolmasnainen.net/\">Pauli Hanhiniemi</a> and the song is written by <a title=\"Juha Tapio\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8MjL8680CQ\">Juha Tapio</a> who is listening the song.

Or both? I know I would. John Saddington wrote an <a title=\"WordPress University: Would You Attend, Teach?\" href=\"http://torquemag.io/wordpress-school/\">article about</a> it and asked us to dream a little. Well, let’s go off road!</p>\n<p>One of the first thing we need to do is curriculum of WordPress school. There are many sources where you can read (<a title=\"WordPress Codex\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/\">Codex</a>, <a title=\"WP Tuts+\" href=\"http://wp.tutsplus.com/\">WPTuts+</a>, <a title=\"Pippin Plugins\" href=\"http://pippinsplugins.com/\">Pippins Plugins</a>, <a title=\"Theme Hybrid\" href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\">Theme Hybrid</a>) and learn about WordPress. You can attend WordCamps, local meetups and (future) <a title=\"Training workshops\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2013/01/23/level-up-training-for-diversitygrowth/\">training workshops</a> but that’s not we’re after. Our goal is to study WordPress basics and more advanced things and finally have a WordPress degree. Learning something in depth takes time and we need a plan how to structure our learning.</p>\n<p>Let’s focus more in <a title=\"wordpress.org\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> in this article but naturally there are some similarities with <a title=\"wordpress.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> also. I’m just going to let my mind flow and list some of the courses I would like to see in WordPress School.</p>\n<p>All courses have classroom teaching, tasks you need to do and online teaching in internet.</p>\n<h3>1.

Graduation work</h3>\n<p>Graduation work can be setting up a customer e-commerce site, creating a plugin or theme and so on. But you need to write in depth documentation how and in what way you did it. Consult with your teacher what would the guidelines be in your work.</p>\n<p>So, what do you think about this first-pass outline?

Plugin already have a nice way how to add sliders in the content area when you edit your post or page. But what if you wanted to have slider outside to loop in header area perhaps. Or even choose between <a title=\"Custom Header\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Headers\">header image</a> or Slider in your header area. Well, a little help from our friend Mr. <a title=\"Theme Customizer\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API\">Customizer</a> you can do that pretty easily.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Editing template files</h2>\n<p>First option is the edit your template files, in this case probably <code>header.php</code>. And when we are talking about public theme you&#8217;d copy <code>header.php</code> in child theme and make modifications in there. In that file all you need to do is add this code.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nif ( function_exists( &#8216;soliloquy_slider&#8217; ) ) soliloquy_slider( &#8216;2112&#8217; );<br />\n`</p>\n<p>It checks if Soliloquy Slider exists (or one of it&#8217;s function) and then output a slider using function <code>soliloquy_slider( '2112' )</code> where 2112 is your slider ID. So you need to change that whatever your slider ID is.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not very easy for end user who have never opened a template file or doesn&#8217;t know anything about FTP and all that stuff.</p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s make it easier using Theme Customizer</h2>\n<p>This is what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/header_image_slider1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-994\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/header_image_slider1.png\" alt=\"Header image or slider\" width=\"283\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/header_image_slider1.png 283w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/header_image_slider1-274x300.png 274w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" /></a></p>\n<p>For end user it&#8217;s easier the select Slider like that. In this example there is also option to choose between header image or slider as you can see from picture.</p>\n<p>This tutorial is not covering all the details how to build Customizer in your theme so I&#8217;m just gonna show code snippets what includes Slider stuff. Let&#8217;s dig into code.</p>\n<p>`<br />\n/* Add the Soliloquy Slider setting. */</p>\n<p>/* Get Slider choices if Soliloquy plugin is activated. */<br />\nif ( post_type_exists( &#8216;soliloquy&#8217; ) ) {</p>\n<p>$kalervo_soliloquy_slider_choices = kalervo_get_soliloquy_slider_choices();</p>\n<p>$wp_customize-&gt;add_setting(<br />\n&#8216;soliloquy_slider&#8217;,<br />\narray(<br />\n&#8216;default&#8217; =&gt; 0,<br />\n&#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;theme_mod&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;capability&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;edit_theme_options&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;sanitize_callback&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;absint&#8217;,<br />\n//&#8217;transport&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;postMessage&#8217;<br />\n)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>/* Add the Soliloquy Slider control. */<br />\n$wp_customize-&gt;add_control(<br />\n&#8216;soliloquy-slider-control&#8217;,<br />\narray(<br />\n&#8216;label&#8217; =&gt; esc_html__( &#8216;Select Soliloquy Slider&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; ),<br />\n&#8216;section&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;layout&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;settings&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;soliloquy_slider&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;select&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;choices&#8217; =&gt; $kalervo_soliloquy_slider_choices<br />\n)<br />\n);<br />\n`</p>\n<p>This is the basic code how you add select drop-down list in theme customizer. And drop-down is only shown if post type <strong>soliloquy</strong> exists. Note that I have <code>layout</code> section already in the theme.</p>\n<p>Important part is setting name <code>soliloquy_slider</code> so that we can get selected slider ID from customizer.</p>\n<p>Function <code>kalervo_get_soliloquy_slider_choices()</code> gets all the sliders that have been created and that&#8217;s pretty simple too.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nfunction kalervo_get_soliloquy_slider_choices() {</p>\n<p>/* Set an array. */<br />\n$kalervo_slider_data = array(<br />\n0 =&gt; __( &#8216;Select Slider&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; )<br />\n);</p>\n<p>/* Get Soliloquy Sliders. */<br />\n$kalervo_soliloquy_args = array(<br />\n&#8216;post_type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;soliloquy&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;posts_per_page&#8217; =&gt; -1<br />\n);</p>\n<p>$kalervo_sliders = get_posts( $kalervo_soliloquy_args );</p>\n<p>/* Loop sliders data. */<br />\nforeach ( $kalervo_sliders as $kalervo_slider ) {<br />\n$kalervo_slider_data[$kalervo_slider-&gt;ID] = $kalervo_slider-&gt;post_title;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>/* Return array. */<br />\nreturn $kalervo_slider_data;</p>\n<p>}<br />\n`</p>\n<p>Basically we are just using <code><a title=\"get_posts\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts\">get_posts()</a></code> function to get slider (post type soliloquy) ID and title in an array.</p>\n<p>Code for choosing between header image or slider goes also in <code>layout</code> section.</p>\n<p>`<br />\n/* == Show header image or Soliloquy Slider == */</p>\n<p>/* Add setting do you want to show header image or Soliloquy Slider. */<br />\n$wp_customize-&gt;add_setting(<br />\n&#8216;show_header_slider&#8217;,<br />\narray(<br />\n&#8216;default&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;header&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;theme_mod&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;capability&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;edit_theme_options&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;sanitize_callback&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;sanitize_html_class&#8217;,<br />\n//&#8217;transport&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;postMessage&#8217;<br />\n)<br />\n);</p>\n<p>/* Header image or Soliloquy Slider control. */</p>\n<p>if ( post_type_exists( &#8216;soliloquy&#8217; ) ) {<br />\n$kalervo_show_header_slider_label = esc_html__( &#8216;Choose whether to show Header Image or Soliloquy Slider in Header?&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; );<br />\n} else {<br />\n$kalervo_show_header_slider_label = esc_html__( &#8216;Choose whether to show Header Image or Soliloquy Slider in Header? Note! You need to install and activate Soliloquy Slider Plugin first.&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; );<br />\n}</p>\n<p>$wp_customize-&gt;add_control(<br />\n&#8216;show-header-slider&#8217;,<br />\narray(<br />\n&#8216;label&#8217; =&gt; $kalervo_show_header_slider_label,<br />\n&#8216;section&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;layout&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;settings&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;show_header_slider&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;radio&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;priority&#8217; =&gt; 10,<br />\n&#8216;choices&#8217; =&gt; array(<br />\n&#8216;header&#8217; =&gt; esc_html__( &#8216;Show Header image&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; ),<br />\n&#8216;slider&#8217; =&gt; esc_html__( &#8216;Show Soliloquy Slider&#8217;, &#8216;kalervo&#8217; )<br />\n)<br />\n)<br />\n);<br />\n`</p>\n<p>If post type soliloquy doesn&#8217;t exists we put notice in label that you should install and activate the plugin first. Other than that it&#8217;s pretty basic radio button selection. Important part is setting name <code>show_header_slider</code> so that we can check in <code>header.php</code> do you have header or slider selected.</p>\n<h2>Template file code</h2>\n<p>Actually in my example theme code is pretty heavy with multiple checks so let&#8217;s make it a little bit easier here. I have so much code that in <code>header.php</code> I call <code><a title=\"get_template_part\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_template_part\">get_template_part</a>()</code> function so that I can use <code>info-header.php</code> file in my theme and it can be copied in child theme if necessary.</p>\n<p>`<br />\n<!--?php get_template_part( 'info', 'header' ); // Loads the info-header.php template. ?--><br />\n`</p>\n<p>Remember that important part <strong>show_header_slider</strong> and <strong>soliloquy_slider</strong>? <code>show_header_slider</code> had only two option; <strong>slider</strong> or <strong>header</strong> and <code>soliloquy_slider</code> gets slider ID. In <code>info-header.php</code> we first check if <code>soliloquy_slider()</code> function exists and if slider is selected using check:</p>\n<p>`<br />\n&#8216;slider&#8217; == get_theme_mod( &#8216;show_header_slider&#8217; )<br />\n`</p>\n<p>Slider ID we can get like this:</p>\n<p>`<br />\nabsint( get_theme_mod( &#8216;soliloquy_slider&#8217;, 0 ) )<br />\n`</p>\n<p>Where <code>0</code> is default Slider ID.</p>\n<p>Then we check if header image is set and if header is chosen in <code>show_header_slider</code> setting. Full check goes something like this:</p>\n<p>`<br />\n/* Get header image. */<br />\n$kalervo_header_image = get_header_image();</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"kalervo-header-image\"></div>\n<p><!-- #kalervo-header-image --></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"kalervo-header-image\">\n</div>\n<p><!-- #kalervo-header-image --> <!--?php </p-->\n<p>}<br />\n}<br />\n`</p>\n<p>If you ask me that&#8217;s a whole lot easier for end user to use slider in header section. Use it wisely though because you should <a title=\"Sliders suck\" href=\"http://krogsgard.com/2013/sliders-suck/\">not use slider everywhere and always</a>.</p>\n<h2>Demo</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m using these snippets in <a title=\"Kalervo\" href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/kalervo/\">Kalervo</a> and <a title=\"Eino\" href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/eino/\">Eino</a> theme.

I also filtered <code>no_id</code> string in <code>functions.php</code> like this.</p>\n<p>`</p>\n<p>/* Filter no_id string in soliloquy. */<br />\nfunction kalervo_soliloquy_no_id_string( $strings ) {</p>\n<p>$kalervo_current_url = ( is_ssl() ? &#8216;https://&#8217; : &#8216;http://&#8217; ) . $_SERVER[&#8216;HTTP_HOST&#8217;] . $_SERVER[&#8216;REQUEST_URI&#8217;];</p>\n<p>$strings[&#8216;no_id&#8217;] = sprintf( __( &#8216;No slider was selected.

I&#8217;ll try to fix it. But anyways that&#8217;s about it, see you next time!</p>\n","<p>If you are building a public theme you might want to integrate Soliloquy Slider Plugin in your theme.

For now I have always used <a href=\"http://www.poedit.net/\" title=\"Poedit\">Poedit</a> for generating my .po/.mo file and not even included .pot file in a theme or plugin. It has worked pretty well and I know that my finnish translations are working just fine. </p>\n<p>But with latest theme project I started to think that <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/translating-custom-page-template-names/\" title=\"Translating custom page template names\">how do I translate custom page template names</a>?

For user translations he uses <a href=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\" title=\"GlotPress\">GlotPress</a>. That seems a great work flow for generating .pot file for your themes and plugins. </p>\n<p>Then I remembered that Tom McFarlin had a blog post about <a href=\"http://tommcfarlin.com/internationalize-wordpress-plugins/\" title=\"How To Internationalize WordPress Plugins\">How To Internationalize WordPress Plugins</a>. I read it again and understood it a lot better. Then I checked <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve\" title=\"Twenty Twelwe\">Twenty Twelwe theme</a> and realized that it has <em>twentytwelve.pot</em> file and it contains strings for custom page template names and for theme description and all!! I want to do the same, right now and right here!</p>\n<h2>Generate .pot file in Windows</h2>\n<p>Most of this is from Tom&#8217;s article but I have W7 and <a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\" title=\"XAMPP\">XAMPP</a> so the process is a little bit different but not hard. But first, why we should even gererate .pot file for our theme or plugin users? Why Poedit might not be the best choice for this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.pot file is the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#gettext_files\" title=\"Translating WordPress\">first template</a> to use and .po/.mo files are generated from it. We don&#8217;t know which software translators are gonna use and .pot extension is the most generic one.</li>\n<li>Poedit doesn&#8217;t pick up custom page template names automatically, even if I found a <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/translating-custom-page-template-names/\" title=\"Translating custom page template names\">way to do it</a>.</li>\n<li>Poedit doesn&#8217;t include theme description and other header info from `style.css`.</li>\n<li>Poedit doesn&#8217;t pick up translators notes like this `/* translators: */`.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Use i18n tools from repo</h3>\n<p>In WordPress repo there is tools for generating correct .pot file. They can be found here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/\" title=\"Tools\">http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/</a></p>\n<p>Now we want to checkout those files from trunk. I created folder `tools` in `wp-content/themes` and checkout trunk using <a href=\"http://tortoisesvn.net/\" title=\"TortoiseSVN\">TortoiseSVN</a>. Just right click your mouse and choose SVN Checkout and you can checkout all the files in the folder `wp-content/themes/tools`. Note that I&#8217;m using XAMPP and localhost for this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/checkout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/checkout.png\" alt=\"checkout\" width=\"484\" height=\"401\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-727\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/checkout.png 484w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/checkout-300x249.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then open your XAMPP control panel and open your shell terminal from the right.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell.png\" alt=\"shell\" width=\"847\" height=\"271\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-734\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell.png 847w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell-300x96.png 300w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell-768x246.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" /></a></p>\n<p>After that navigate the the right folder, I used `cd htdocs/foxnet-themes/wp-content/themes`. To generate .pot file we need to use command like this.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nphp tools/makepot.php wp-theme theme-folder-name<br />\n`</p>\n<p>This scans your folder (theme) `theme-folder-name` and generates file `theme-folder-name.pot` in `wp-content/themes`. Naturally you&#8217;ll want to move this file to correct folder in your theme, perhaps in `languages` folder.</p>\n<p>For plugins you can use command like this.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nphp tools/makepot.php wp-plugin plugin-directory<br />\n`</p>\n<p>For example I used command</p>\n<p>`<br />\nphp tools/makepot.php wp-theme kalervo<br />\n`</p>\n<p>for my theme and moved `kalervo.pot` file to folder `wp-content/themes/kalervo/languages`. I got some notices but this really works great and now there is no need to manually add theme description, page template names and all the other header info. </p>\n<p>Note! You still need to use your text domain in your <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header#Plugin_File_Header_Example\" title=\"Plugin header\">plugin header</a> or <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header#Theme_File_Header_Example\" title=\"Theme header\">theme header</a> in `style.css` so that custom page template names and theme description translations actually gonna work. So add this in header.</p>\n<p>`<br />\nText Domain: my-text-domain<br />\n`</p>\n<p>And replace `my-text-domain` with your actual theme or plugin text domain.</p>\n<h2>What about Poedit?</h2>\n<p>I still use Poedit for my translation work. As a matter a fact I have already translated most of the strings in my theme using Poedit before I created correct .pot file. Do I have to do everything again now? I could have manually copy and paste translations from old file to new file but luckily there is a <strong>Update from POT file</strong> function in Poedit. It&#8217;s under Catalogue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/update_from_pot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/update_from_pot.png\" alt=\"update_from_pot\" width=\"313\" height=\"165\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-741\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/update_from_pot.png 313w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/update_from_pot-300x158.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With this command users or I can update their existing .po files using Poedit. Naturally other tools like GlotPress are better for community translations. But that&#8217;s another topic. I hope you liked this one.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: When using <em>Update from POT file</em> in Poedit, it doesn&#8217;t clean up the obsolete text strings. You&#8217;ll have to do it manually opening up .po file and look for the end of the file. Just delete all the strings that starts with `#~`. Notice the `~` sign.</p>\n","<p>I&#8217;ve been re-thinking my thoughts about internationalizing WordPress themes or plugins.

I just saw one version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein\" title=\"Frankestein\">Frankenstein</a> in Finnish Theatre and I felt like I was building <a href=\"http://www.metallica.com/releases/some-kind-of-monster-movie.asp\" title=\"Some Kind of Monster\">some kind of monster</a> myself at the same time. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Theme is officially called Eino. It&#8217;s the name of my mothers father (died in a war long before I was born) and he has nothing to do with the nickname Franter. The theme I was building seems to be half of Frankestein, half Monster. And I like it!</p>\n<h2>Support for all kind of plugins</h2>\n<p>Why do I call it Franter? Because when I started building this theme it was supposed to be one column blogging theme. But then <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/satu\" title=\"Satu WordPress Theme\">Satu theme</a> was released and it was pretty much what I already had in hands so I started adding stuff to the theme. And when I finished one part of the theme, I added another part. And another one. And another one.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/eino/\" title=\"Eino demosite\">check out the demo</a> and here are couple of supported plugins for the theme.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/\" title=\"Custom Content Portfolio\">Custom Content Portfolio</a></strong>: For showing off your portfolio install Custom Content Portfolio Plugin and you&#8217;re <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/eino/portfolio/\" title=\"Portfolio\">ready to go</a>.

But I still don&#8217;t like the styles of bbPress or how it looks on mobile devices. That&#8217;s why I like to give bbPress <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/eino/topics/\" title=\"bbPress haircut\">a nice little haircut</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress\" title=\"BuddyPress\">BuddyPress</a></strong>: I haven&#8217;t used BuddyPress on a live site so it was fun to notice that it works the same way as bbPress. It&#8217;s still a work in progress but I&#8217;m getting somewhere. It&#8217;s the same as with bbPress and I just need to roll my own styles to it. Hmmm for multisite demo I have problems setting up a BuddyPress.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/\" title=\"Easy Digital Download\">Easy Digital Download</a></strong>: EDD has become one of my favorite plugin so naturally I wanted to give <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/eino/downloads/\" title=\"EDD love\">some love</a> to it. </li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/\" title=\"Woocommerce\">Woocommerce</a></strong>: Hey if you need to sell other than digital downloads, <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/eino/shop/\" title=\"Woocommerce\">Woocommerce</a> is a must plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Theme is bloated with CSS</h2>\n<p>No, not really. Naturally there are some extra lines of CSS in themes <code>style.css</code> but not that much. And plugins CSS files are only loaded when you actually install and activate the plugin. So there is no extra bloat.</p>\n<p><strong>But who needs all those plugins?</strong></p>\n<p>For most of the sites you won&#8217;t need all those plugins at the same time. But if you think rock artist for example, they might even need all of those. They want to communicate with their fans and bbPRess and BuddyPress gives you tools for that. And you definitely want to sell your digital downloads or t-shirts in your site.</p>\n<h2>Theme Customize</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_619\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-619\" style=\"width: 298px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Eino_Customize.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Eino_Customize.jpg\" alt=\"You can do crazy stuff with theme Customize\" width=\"298\" height=\"627\" class=\"size-full wp-image-619\" srcset=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Eino_Customize.jpg 298w, https://foxland.foxnet.fi/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Eino_Customize-143x300.jpg 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-619\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">You can do crazy stuff with theme Customize</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I admit that I went too far with Theme Customize.

All you need to do is upload different backgrounds under Appearance >> Background.</li>\n<li>choose global layout to be one column, two colums or three columns.

When you purchase this theme, you also get blank child theme. If you want do it yourself, here is how to get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a theme folder in your <code>/wp-content/themes</code> directory called <code>hopeareunus-child</code>.</li>\n<li>After that create a <code>style.css</code> file in <code>/wp-content/themes/hopeareunus-child</code> folder.</li>\n<li>At the top of your <code>style.css</code> file, add the below information.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>/**\r\n * Theme Name: Hopeareunus Child\r\n * Theme URI: http://link-to-your-site.com\r\n * Description: Describe your child theme.\r\n * Version: 0.1\r\n * Author: Your Name\r\n * Author URI: http://link-to-your-site.com\r\n * Tags: Some, Tags\r\n * Template: hopeareunus\r\n */</code></pre>\n<p>There is no reason to import parent theme styles, because they are loaded automatically. Note! If you compress your <code>style.css</code> and copy your styles to a file called <code>style.min.css</code>, it will be used automatically.</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" title=\"Child Themes\">child theme</a> is officially-supported way of modifying themes in WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Supported plugins</h2>\n<p><strong>Custom Content Portfolio</strong></p>\n<p>Theme is designed for showing off your work with <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-portfolio//\" title=\"Custom Content Portfolio\">Custom Content Portfolio</a>.

You can always Deactivate the license key as well.</p>\n<h2>Theme Settings (Appearance &raquo;&raquo; Customize)</h2>\n<p>Most of the theme setting is under Appearance &raquo;&raquo; Customize. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there is no millions of different options in the theme. Just the basic ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Set logo</strong></p>\n<p>Set logo under Appearance &raquo;&raquo; Customize &raquo;&raquo; Logo Upload. Suggested logo size is 300 x 79 (in pixels).

If you need to overwrite page templates in a child theme, create subfolder <code>page-templates</code> in child theme and copy certain page template in that folder and start modifying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front Page (front-page.php): This is for showing your latest posts and portfolios. There is also Front page widget area for this page template.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou can select a page template from the &#8220;Template&#8221; section of the &#8220;Attributes&#8221; meta box when writing or editing a page.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you want to use Front Page template as a front page for your site instead of the standard blog post view, follow these instructions.\n</p>\n<h3>Creating the front page</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First create a new page. You can name it anything. For example &#8220;Home&#8221; or &#8220;Portfolio&#8221;.</li>\n<li>When creating this page, select &#8220;Front Page&#8221; from the &#8220;Template&#8221; drop-down inside of the &#8220;Attributes&#8221; meta box.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Change site front page</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Settings &raquo;&raquo; Reading&#8221; screen in the admin to adjust the page shown on the front of the site.</li>\n<li>Locate the section labeled &#8220;Front page displays&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;A static page&#8221;.</li>\n<li>In the &#8220;Front Page&#8221; drop-down, select the page you created earlier that has the &#8220;Front Page&#8221; template.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Flexible subsidiary and front page widgets</h2>\n<p>You can use 1, 2, 3 or 4 widgets in subsidiary and front page widgets areas and the layout is still gonna look nice. The original idea having flexible and responsive widget areas is from <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/themes/sukelius-magazine\" title=\"Sukelius\">Sukelius Theme</a>.</p>\n<h2>Theme support</h2>\n<p>Support for the <em>Hopeareunus</em> theme is not offered on the WordPress support forums.

Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Larry Bird and others really put on a great show. That was a real <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_men%27s_Olympic_basketball_team\" title=\"Dream Team\" target=\"_blank\">Dream Team</a>. But wait, was I supposed to write about Dream Themes, not Dream Teams.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Well there are some similarities in sports and WordPress Theme development. We need to dream as high as possible, we need to train hard to achieve our goals, we need to have right tools in right places and we need great people to put their ideas together. Actually in this article I try to think what kind of themes would be my dream themes. And what kind of themes I would like to coach (build).</p>\n<h3>Business and Portfolio theme</h3>\n<p>I actually have been building this one already and going to publish it in couple of weeks. Here is a early <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/hopeareunus/\" title=\"Hopeareunus\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a>. It&#8217;s called <em>Hopeareunus</em>. </p>\n<p>What I want in business theme is that pages get extra attention. For this theme it means that you can change header image in every page/post and for pages you can write some intro text using build in excerpt feature. Nice. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that blog features are going to be left out. </p>\n<p>It also needs Custom Post Type for your portfolio items. And as we all know, custom post types should be in a plugin. I decided to support <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-portfolio/\" title=\"Custom Content Portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Content Portfolio</a> Plugin because I wanted a plugin, which is simple to use. And I trust the man behind it.</p>\n<p>Front page also needs the be as simple as possible but in the same time it shows your latest portfolio and articles. I won&#8217;t go too much in details in this article. You get the general idea in <a href=\"http://foxnet-themes.fi/demo/hopeareunus/\" title=\"Hopeareunus\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a>.</p>\n<h3>Simple Blogging Theme with one column layout</h3>\n<p>There are several theme authors who have been building one column layout themes. I want to build one too! Because it looks cool and it really put your content at first priority. And Post Formats get some extra shine.</p>\n<h3>Theme for artists</h3>\n<p>I love music and and rock &#8216;n roll site is definitely in my plans. I see big header image, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\" title=\"Soundcloud\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a> or HTML5 player for music, good social links, <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" title=\"EDD\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Digital Download</a> for selling your music, <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" title=\"Woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">Woocommerce</a> for selling non digital products, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress/\" title=\"bbPRess\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress</a> for forums. Okay, it takes couple of years to build one. Maybe I start a little smaller scale. </p>\n<h3>E-commerce theme</h3>\n<p>Well if I can pull theme for artists, I can definitely pull it of with just support for Woocommerce theme. <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/kultalusikka/\" title=\"Kultalusikka\">Kultalusikka</a> already takes care of <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\" title=\"EDD\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Digital Download</a>.</p>\n<h3>Magazine theme</h3>\n<p>My first attempt with Magazine theme was <a href=\"https://foxland.foxnet.fi/downloads/path/\" title=\"Path\">Path</a>. I think it&#8217;s pretty solid one. But I want to rebuild the layout again at some point.</p>\n<h3>Sports theme</h3>\n<p>Sport is my other passion along with music. So why not try to make theme for sport. I don&#8217;t have a lot of ideas right now how it should work. But <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network\" title=\"Multisite\" target=\"_blank\">Multisite</a> install would be something I would recommend for bigger society. Then each group could have their own site. For sport site we also need custom plugins like <em>Athletes</em>. It would have basic information about athletes, so Custom Post Type would be way to go.</p>\n<h3>Theme for restaurants</h3>\n<p>I really want to test <a href=\"http://www.happytables.com/framework-developers/\" title=\"Happy Tables\">Happy Tables</a> for restaurants site. They have a great idea behind it and they have opened it for developers. How cool is that. I wonder how it works with <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\" title=\"Hybrid Core\" target=\"_blank\">Hybrid Core</a>.</p>\n<h3>Basic themes</h3>\n<p>Lot&#8217;s of themes can just be general themes with different layouts. Most of the future themes could be just this kind of themes that you can use it pretty much any type of site you want.</p>\n<p>What kind of themes would you like the see? Photoblogging, pets, you name it.</p>\n","<p>I remember like it was yesterday. Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen, Larry Bird and others really put on a great show.

I started out using <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\" title=\"wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.com</a> blogs and boy, they were easy to maintain. All you had to do was create some content. But after a while I wanted full control of my theme and layout. So I installed my first <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\" title=\"wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.org</a> software in my own domain and I was happy as a songbird. I went through all the things in the admin about million times and tried to understand how WordPress worked. </p>\n<p>After that I fell in love with a beautiful theme. And in the next day I saw even more beautiful theme. I must have her! And I did, it was free. This happened me day after day but finally I settled down. I found what I was looking for. But after a while I wanted to know how it worked and find the inner beauty of her. I found <code>style.css</code>. What if I just change one little thing, maybe try different background color. She didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all. Next day I changed a link color and we were having fun!</p>\n<p>She only spoke english words and I really wanted to teach some finnish words to my theme. I went through all the template files and translated strings to finnish. And once again she didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all. I love her.</p>\n<p>Aaa there is a notice that I can update my theme. I will most certainly do it right away, who knows what cool features there might be. Okay her we go, updating the theme and go visit some of my post.</p>\n<p>WHAT THE F&#8230;SOMEONE BROKE MY SITE!!!!!!!!???? MY THEME LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT DID BEFORE!!! UGLY. AND ALL ENGLISH.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t understand what was going on, I was confused. Who ever made this theme he must pay for this big time. I know how WordPress works, I&#8217;m a WordPress Ninja for crying out loud! </p>\n<p>After I calmed myself down and started to google what was going on, I realized I had done everything in the wrong way. <strong>You should never, ever modify parent theme files. You will lose theme when you update the theme</strong>. WordPress have this create concept of <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" title=\"Child Themes\" target=\"_blank\">Child Themes</a>. Always make your modifications to child theme. Lesson learnt.</p>\n<p>But I was still sad. I never saw her again.</p>\n","<p>YOU BROKE MY SITE!!!!!!!!???? AFTER UPDATE ALL MY MODIFICATIONS ARE GONE, PLEASE HELP ME FIX IT!!!!!!!
